## Policies

### Zoom

Discussions will be held in-person, but I'll also broadcast them live. ([Zoom](https://ucla.zoom.us/j/96801067704))

### Homework

The homework will be graded as follows:

-   You must attempt to complete every problem on the homework, or else you will receive as zero on the whole assignment.
    -   What I consider "complete" is at my own discretion, but as a rule of thumb, if you wrote down what you think is a correct solution, then you will get full points for that problem.
-   Your total score will be based on the correctness of 2 problems chosen at random.

### Participation

Each discussion, I will check the attendance of 6-7 students chosen at random. I'll have a photo roster with me, so please don't try to check in for a different student.

If you're joining the discussion over Zoom, please be prepared to turn on your camera briefly so that I can make sure you're actually there.

### Office Hours

If you're unable to attend my office hours for any reason, feel free to send me an e-mail and we can set up an appointment to meet at a different time and place, including evenings and over Zoom.

### E-mails

I'm usually quick to respond to e-mails, so if you don't get a reply by the end of the day, feel free to send another one. Also, please address me as Steven.
