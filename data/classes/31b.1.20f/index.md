The password to all the Zoom meetings is `integrals`. I won't be recording discussions, so to make up for this, I'll be writing detailed discussion notes.

If you have any feedback, please fill out the [anonymous feedback form](https://forms.gle/o8YAcB2giVJ5jLK26). This can include anything from pacing to topics you want me to cover each week.

I try my best to be very quick with e-mails, so if you don't get a reply by the end of the day, feel free to send me another e-mail. You can call me Steven (but _not_ Mr. Truong).

## Announcements

-   | 12/11/20 | It looks like the textbook I linked to previously was taken down, so you should try to ask other students to see if they have a PDF. If you still have trouble getting access to the textbook, feel free to send me an e-mail and I'll point you in the right direction.
