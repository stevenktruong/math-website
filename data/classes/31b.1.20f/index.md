The password to all the Zoom meetings is `integrals`. I won't be recording discussions, so to make up for this, I'll be writing detailed discussion notes.

If you have any feedback, please fill out the [anonymous feedback form](https://forms.gle/o8YAcB2giVJ5jLK26). This can include anything from pacing to topics you want me to cover each week.

When e-mailing me, please include `[31B]` somewhere in the subject so it doesn't get lost. I try my best to be very responsive, so if you don't get a reply by the end of the day, feel free to send me another e-mail. You can call me Steven (but _not_ Mr. Truong).
