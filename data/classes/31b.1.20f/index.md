The password to all the Zoom meetings is `integrals`.

When e-mailing me, please include `[31B]` somewhere in the subject so it doesn't get lost. I try my best to be very responsive, so if you don't get a reply by the end of the day, feel free to send me another e-mail. You can call me Steven (but _not_ Mr. Truong).
