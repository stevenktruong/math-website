## Table of Contents

## Policies

### Discussion Sections

Discussion sections will be centered around weekly worksheets (which can be found [here](https://pabloocal.github.io/Teaching/SMATH115AL12023/index.html#Discussion)). **I will be grading the starred questions for completeness** and the remaining problems are for you to practice.

Our class has [learning assistants](https://ceils.ucla.edu/learning-communities-trainings/learning-assistant-program/), who are undergrads who have taken this class and are here to support you.

### Homework

If you haven't already, this is a good time to learn how to use LaTeX and start typing up your homework assignments. I recommend using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) if you've never typed up math before. **This is not a requirement**, so you can still write up your homework however you like (e.g., with a tablet, scanning a separate sheet of paper, etc.).

Homework should be turned in through Gradescope, and it will be graded by a reader. This means that **none of the TA's are grading your homework**.

### Office Hours

If you're unable to attend my office hours, then feel free to send me an e-mail and we can set up an appointment to meet at a different time. You're also free to go to any other instructor's office hours (a list can be found in the syllabus).

### E-mails

I'm usually quick to respond to e-mails, so if you don't get a reply by the end of the day, feel free to send another one. Also, please address me as Steven.
