### Homework

If you haven't already, this is a good time to learn how to use LaTeX and start typing up your homework assignments. I recommend using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Tutorials) if you've never typed up math before. **This is not a requirement**, so you can still write up your homework however you like (e.g., with a tablet, scanning a separate sheet of paper, etc.) as long as I can read it.

<!-- Here's how homework will be graded:

-   In every homework assignment, each problem will be worth the same number of points.
-   I will choose ~3 problems to grade for correctness, and the remaining problems will be graded for completion.
    -   What I consider "complete" is at my own discretion, but as a rule of thumb, if you wrote down what you think is a correct solution, then you will get full points for that problem. -->

### Office Hours

If you're unable to attend my office hours, then feel free to send me an e-mail and we can set up an appointment to meet at a different time.

### E-mails

I'm usually quick to respond to e-mails, so if you don't get a reply by the end of the day, feel free to send another one. Also, please address me as Steven.
