## Table of Contents

## Policies

### Discussion Sections

In this class, **discussion attendance is required each Tuesday and Thursday**. If for any reason you can't attend, please let me know as soon as possible.

### Homework

In this class, **typing up your homework is required**. I recommend using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Tutorials) if you've never typed up math before.

Homework should be turned in through Gradescope, and it will be graded by a reader. This means that **none of the TA's are grading your homework**.

### Office Hours

If you're unable to attend my office hours, then feel free to send me an e-mail and we can set up an appointment to meet at a different time. You're also free to go to any other instructor's office hours (a list can be found in the syllabus).

### E-mails

I'm usually quick to respond to e-mails, so if you don't get a reply by the end of the day, feel free to send another one. Also, please address me as Steven.
