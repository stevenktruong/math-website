## Policies

### Zoom

The password to all of my Zoom meetings is `epsilon`. To access the meetings, make sure you're logged in through UCLA:

1. If you're signed into Zoom with a personal e-mail, sign out.
2. Click `Sign In with SSO`.
3. Type `ucla` for the company domain.
4. Finish signing in through UCLA.

I won't be recording discussions, so to make up for this, I'll be writing detailed discussion notes and posting them on this page.

### Homework

If you haven't already, this is a good time to learn how to use LaTeX and start typing up your homework assignments. I recommend using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) if you've never typed up math before.

### Emails

I'm usually quick to respond to e-mails, so if you don't get a reply by the end of the day, feel free to send another one. Also, please address me as Steven when e-mailing me.
