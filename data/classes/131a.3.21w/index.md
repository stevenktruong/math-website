## Policies

### Zoom

The password to all of my Zoom meetings is `epsilon`. To access the meetings, make sure you're logged in through UCLA:

1. If you're signed into Zoom with a personal e-mail, sign out.
2. Click `Sign In with SSO`.
3. Type `ucla` for the company domain.
4. Finish signing in through UCLA.

I started recording discussions Week 3, and all recordings will be available on CCLE. I will be posting my usual notes in addition to this on my website as well.

### Homework

If you haven't already, this is a good time to learn how to use LaTeX and start typing up your homework assignments. I recommend using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) if you've never typed up math before. This is not a requirement, so you can still write up your homework however you like (e.g., with a tablet, scanning a separate sheet of paper, etc.) as long as I can read it.

The homework will be graded as follows:

-   50% will be awarded for attempting to solve every problem completely.
    -   What I consider "complete" is at my own discretion, but as a rule of thumb, if you wrote down what you think is a correct solution, then you will get full points for that problem.
-   The remaining 50% will be based on correctness of a few (usually 2-3) problems chosen at random.

### Office Hours

If you're unable to attend my office hours, then feel free to send me an e-mail and we can set up an appointment to meet at a different time.

### E-mails

I'm usually quick to respond to e-mails, so if you don't get a reply by the end of the day, feel free to send another one. Also, please address me as Steven when e-mailing me.
