## Policies

### COVID-19

Following the school's COVID-19 policies, discussions will be held in person and masks will be required unless you have an exemption.

### Office Hours

If you're unable to attend my office hours for any reason, feel free to send me an e-mail and we can set up an appointment to meet at a different time and place, including over Zoom.

### E-mails

I'm usually quick to respond to e-mails, so if you don't get a reply by the end of the day, feel free to send another one. Try to include `31B` somewhere in the subject so it doesn't get flagged as spam. Also, please address me as Steven when e-mailing me.
