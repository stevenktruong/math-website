### Homework

If you haven't already, this is a good time to learn how to use LaTeX and start typing up your homework assignments. I recommend using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) if you've never typed up math before. **This is not a requirement**, so you can still write up your homework however you like (e.g., with a tablet, scanning a separate sheet of paper, etc.) as long as I can read it.

### Office Hours

If you're unable to attend my office hours, then feel free to send me an e-mail and we can set up an appointment to meet at a different time.

### E-mails

I'm usually quick to respond to e-mails, so if you don't get a reply by the end of the day, feel free to send another one. Also, please address me as Steven.
