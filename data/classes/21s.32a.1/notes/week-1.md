## Sketching Axes

This is a right and wrong way to sketch axes. For example,

You can check if your axes are correct using the [right-hand rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule). There are several variants of the right-hand rule, but here is how I do it: point the non-thumb fingers of your right hand in the direction of the $x$-axis, and curl them in the direction of the $y$-axis. Your thumb should point in the direction of the $z$-axis if you've drawn them correctly.

## Conic Sections

Conic sections are called so because they come from cutting cones with a plane. Look at this [GeoGebra graph](https://www.geogebra.org/3d/q43cksyg)) to see what I mean: when you tilt the plane (e.g., by sliding $a$, $b$, or $c$) and look at their intersections, you'll see that there can only be three possibilities:

### Ellipses

When the plane is close to being flat, you'll get an ellipse:

### Parabolas

When the plane is parallel with one of the halves of the cone, you get a parabola:

### Hyperbola

Finally, when the plane intersects both halves of the cones, you get a hyperbola:
