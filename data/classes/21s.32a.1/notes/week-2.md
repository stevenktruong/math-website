## Vectors

As a reminder, please make sure to denote your vectors with arrows on top. For example, write $\vec{v}$ and **not** $v$ to denote a vector. This will help you avoid making common mistakes. For example,

1. $\vec{v}\vec{w}$ is clearly illegal, but if you just write $vw$, then you might overlook this.
2. Similarly, $\frac{\vec{v}}{\vec{w}}$ stands out, but $\frac{v}{w}$ looks like a regular fraction.
