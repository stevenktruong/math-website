I'm a second year Ph.D. student at the [UCLA Department of Mathematics](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/) studying analysis. I was also an undergraduate at UCLA, where I obtained both my B.S. in Mathematics of Computation and my M.A. in Mathematics through the Departmental Scholars Program.

## Office Hours

You're welcome to come to any of my office hours, but if there are too many students, I'll be prioritizing the students in the specified class.

All my office hours will be online until the administration allows us to return in-person (currently, we are planning to return in-person on January 18th). Once this happens, all of my office hours will be held in-person in my office with the exception of my open office hours, which will be online all quarter.
