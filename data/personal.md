I'm a fourth year Ph.D. student at the [UCLA Department of Mathematics](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/) researching random matrix theory under my advisor [Jun Yin](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~jyin/). I was also an undergraduate at UCLA, where I obtained both my B.S. in Mathematics of Computation and my M.A. in Mathematics through the Departmental Scholars Program.

## Office Hours

Anyone is welcome to come to any of my office hours, but if too many people show up, I'll be prioritizing the students in the specified class.

I'm not holding any office hours this summer.
