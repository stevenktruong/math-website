I'm currently a research scientist at Meta.

I received my Ph.D. in mathematics from the [UCLA Department of Mathematics](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/) in 2025 under the supervision of [Professor Jun Yin](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~jyin/). My research was in random matrix theory, where I used machine-assisted graph expansion to study the primitive and interaction hierarchies. I was also an undergraduate at UCLA, where I obtained both my B.S. in Mathematics of Computation and my M.A. in Mathematics through the Departmental Scholars Program.

This website contains an archive of my teaching and qualifying exam webpages from when I was graduate student.
