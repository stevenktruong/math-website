I'm a second year Ph.D. student at the [UCLA Department of Mathematics](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/) studying analysis. I was also an undergraduate at UCLA, where I obtained both my B.S. in Mathematics of Computation and my M.A. in Mathematics through the Departmental Scholars Program.

In my free time, I like to play Valorant, read One Piece, and work on this website.
