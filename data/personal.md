I'm a fourth year Ph.D. student at the [UCLA Department of Mathematics](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/) (soon to be) researching random matrix theory under my advisor [Jun Yin](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~jyin/). I was also an undergraduate at UCLA, where I obtained both my B.S. in Mathematics of Computation and my M.A. in Mathematics through the Departmental Scholars Program.
