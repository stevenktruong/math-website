Let $\Omega_1 \subseteq \Omega_2$ be bounded Jordan domains in $\C$. We also assume that $0 \in \Omega_1$. Now suppose $\func{f_1}{\D}{\Omega_1}$ and $\func{f_2}{\D}{\Omega_2}$ are Riemann mappings, satisfying $f_1\p{0} = f_2\p{0} = 0$. Show that

$$
\abs{f_1'\p{0}} \leq \abs{f_2'\p{0}}.
$$

<solution>

First, notice that $\func{f_2^{-1} \circ f_1}{\D}{\D}$ is holomorphic, since we had Riemann mappings. Observe also that

$$
\begin{aligned}
    f_2^{-1} \circ f_2 = \id
        &\implies \p{f_2^{-1}}'\p{f_2\p{z}} f_2'\p{z} = 1 \\
        &\implies \p{f_2^{-1}}'\p{f_2\p{z}} = \frac{1}{f_2'\p{z}}.
\end{aligned}
$$

In particular, when $z = 0$, we have

$$
f_2^{-1}\p{0} = \frac{1}{f_2'\p{0}},
$$

since $f_2\p{0} = 0$. Thus, by the Schwarz lemma and the fact that $f_1\p{0} = 0$, we see

$$
\abs{\p{f_2^{-1} \circ f}'\p{0}} \leq 1
\implies \abs{f_2^{-1}\p{f_1\p{0}}f'\p{0}} \leq 1
\implies \abs{f_1'\p{0}} \leq \abs{f_2'\p{0}},
$$

which was what we wanted to show.
