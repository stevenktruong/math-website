Find a conformal map of the domain

$$
D = \set{z \in \C \mid \abs{z - 1} < \sqrt{2},\ \abs{z + 1} < \sqrt{2}}
$$

onto the open unit disc centered at the origin. It suffices to write this map as a composition of explicit conformal maps.

$D$ is the unit of two circles which intersect at $i$ and $-i$ at an angle of $\frac{\pi}{2}$. First, we translate so one of the intersection points is at the origin:

$$
\func{\phi_1}{D}{\Omega_1 = D + i},
\quad \phi_1\p{z} = z + i.
$$

Next, we send the other intersection point $2i$ to $\infty$ in a symmetric way. More specifically, we want $0 \mapsto 0$, $i \mapsto i$, and $2i \mapsto \infty$, so we get

$$
\func{\phi_2}{\Omega_1}{\Omega_2},
\quad \phi_2\p{z} = \frac{iz}{2i - z}.
$$

Observe that

$$
\phi_2\p{z}
    = \frac{iz\p{-2i - \conj{z}}}{\abs{2i - z}^2}
    = \frac{2z - i\abs{z}^2}{\abs{2i - z}^2}
    = \frac{2\Re{z}}{\abs{2i - z}^2} + i\p{\frac{2\Im{z} - \abs{z}^2}{\abs{2i - z}^2}}.
$$

In other words, because $D + i$ was symmetric about $\Re{z} = 0$, it follows that $\Omega_2$ is also symmetric about $\Re{z} = 0$. Since angles are preserved by conformal mappings, we see that the circles are mapped to half-lines containing $0$ which intersect at an angle of $\frac{\pi}{2}$. Again by symmetry, we see that $\Omega_2 = \set{\frac{\pi}{4} < \Arg{z} < \frac{3\pi}{4}}$, where we take the standard branch $\p{0, 2\pi}$. After the rotation

$$
\func{\phi_3}{\Omega_2}{\Omega_3 = \set{0 < \Arg{z} < \frac{\pi}{2}}},
\quad \phi_3\p{z} = e^{-i\pi/4}z,
$$

we get the first quadrant. Thus, we can complete the problem with

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \func{\phi_4&}{\Omega_3}{\Omega_4 = \H},
        \quad &&\phi_4\p{z} = z^2 \\
    \func{\phi_5&}{\Omega_4}{\Omega_5 = \D},
        \quad &&\phi_5\p{z} = \frac{z - i}{z + i},
\end{aligned}
$$

so the desired conformal mapping is $\phi_5 \circ \cdots \circ \phi_1$.
