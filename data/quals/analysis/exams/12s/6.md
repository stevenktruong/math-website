Suppose $f \in L^2\p{\R}$ and that the Fourier transform obeys $\hat{f}\p{\xi} > 0$ for almost every $\xi$. Show that the set of finite linear combinations of translates of $f$ is dense in the Hilbert space $L^2\p{\R}$.

<solution>

For $a \in \R$, let $f_a\p{x} = f\p{x - a}$ be the translate of $f$ by $a$. First, notice that by a translation change of variables,

$$
\hat{f_a}\p{\xi}
    = \int e^{-2\pi i\xi x} f\p{x - a} \,\diff{x}
    = \int e^{-2\pi i\xi \p{x+a}} f\p{x} \,\diff{x}
    = e^{-2\pi i\xi a} \hat{f}\p{\xi}.
$$

Let $\mathcal{M}$ be the closure of the span of $\set{f_a}_{a\in\R}$, and suppose $g \in \mathcal{M}^\perp$. Then by Plancherel, we have for any $a \in \R$ that

$$
0
    = \inner{f_a, g}
    = \inner{\hat{f_a}, \hat{g}}
    = \int e^{-2\pi i\xi a} \hat{f}\p{\xi} \hat{g}\p{\xi} \,\diff\xi.
$$

Let $h\p{\xi} = \hat{f}\p{\xi}\hat{g}\p{\xi}$. Then the equality above implies that $\hat{h} = 0$ almost everywhere. By another application of Plancherel, we have $\norm{h}_{L^2} = \bigl\lVert \hat{h} \bigr\rVert_{L^2} = 0$, so $h = 0$ almost everywhere as well. Since $\hat{f}\p{\xi} > 0$ almost everywhere, it follows that $\hat{g}\p{\xi} = 0$ almost everywhere, and so $\norm{g}_{L^2} = \norm{\hat{g}}_{L^2} = 0$, i.e., $g = 0$ almost everywhere. We have shown that $\mathcal{M}^\perp = \set{0}$, so $\mathcal{M}$ is all of $L^2\p{\R}$. By definition, this means that the translates of $f$ are dense in $L^2\p{\R^3}$, which completes the proof.
