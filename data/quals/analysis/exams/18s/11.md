<problem>

For $R > 1$, let $A_R$ be the annulus $\set{1 < \abs{z} < R}$. Assume there is a conformal (i.e., injective, holomorphic) mapping $F$ from $A_{R_1}$ onto $A_{R_2}$. Prove that $R_1 = R_2$.

<solution>

First, suppose $F$ maps $\partial\D$ to $\partial\D_{R_2}$. Then if we replace $F$ with $\frac{R_2}{F}$, which is holomorphic since $F\p{z} \neq 0$, we see that if $\abs{z} = 1$, then

$$
\abs{\frac{R_2}{F\p{z}}}
    = \frac{R_2}{R_2}
    = 1.
$$

Since $\frac{1}{z}$ is an automorphism of $\C \setminus \set{0}$, it follows that $\frac{R_2}{F}$ is still conformal. Hence, without loss of generality, we may assume that $F$ maps $\partial\D$ to $\partial\D$, and so $F$ maps $\partial\D_{R_1}$ to $\partial\D_{R_2}$.

Let

$$
G\p{z}
    =   \begin{cases}
            F\p{z} & \text{if } 1 \leq \abs{z} \leq R_1, \\
            \conj{1/F\p{1/\conj{z}}} & \text{if } R_1^{-1} \leq \abs{z} \leq 1.
        \end{cases}
$$

If $\abs{z} = 1$, then because $\abs{F\p{z}} = 1$ also, we get

$$
\conj{1/F\p{1/\conj{z}}}
    = \conj{1/F\p{z}}
    = F\p{z},
$$

so $G$ is continuous at $\partial\D$. By the Schwarz reflection principle, $F$ extends holomorphically to a map $\func{F}{A_{R_1}}{\D}$ such that if $\abs{z} = R_1^{-1}$, then

$$
\frac{1}{\abs{z}}
    = R_1
\implies
\abs{F\p{1/\conj{z}}}
    = R_2
\implies
\abs{G\p{z}}
    = \frac{1}{\abs{F\p{1/\conj{z}}}}
    = R_2^{-1}.
$$

By induction, $F$ extends to a holomorphic map $\func{F}{\D \setminus \set{0}}{\D}$ such that if $\abs{z} = R_1^{-k}$, then $\abs{F\p{z}} = R_2^{-k}$ for infinitely many $k \in \N$. Since $F$ is bounded near $0$, we see that $0$ is a removable singularity, and because $R_1^{-k} \mapsto R_2^{-k}$, we see that $F\p{0} = 0$. Hence, the Schwarz lemma applies, so

$$
\abs{F\p{z}} \leq \abs{z}
\implies R_2^{-k} \leq R_1^{-k}
\implies R_1 \leq R_2.
$$

Running the same argument with $F^{-1}$, we see that $R_1 = R_2$, by symmetry.
