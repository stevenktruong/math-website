Let $\Omega \subseteq \C$ be open, bounded, and simply connected. Let $u$ be harmonic in $\Omega$ and assume that $u \geq 0$. Show the following: for each compact set $K \subseteq \Omega$, there exists a constant $C_K > 0$ such that

$$
\sup_{x \in K} u\p{x} \leq C_K \inf_{x \in K} u\p{x}.
$$

First, we will show that we can replace $K$ with a connected compact set. Let $\delta = \frac{1}{2}d\p{K, \Omega^\comp} > 0$ and for each $z \in K$, notice that $B\p{z, \delta} \subseteq \Omega$. By compactness, there exist finitely many balls which cover $K$, and this cover has finitely many connected components (since there are only finitely many balls). Thus, replacing $K$ with the closure of these balls, we may assume without loss of generality that $K$ has finitely many connected components. Since $\Omega$ is (path) connected, we can connect these components with finitely many curves. Replacing $K$ with $K$ union these curves, we may thus assume without loss of generality that $K$ is a connected compact set.

For each $z \in K$, let $R_z > 0$ be such that $\cl{B\p{z, 2R_z}} \subseteq \Omega$. By compactness, there exist $z_1, \ldots, z_N$ such that $\set{B\p{z_n, R_n}}_n$ cover $K$. Fix a $z_0 \in K$. For any $z \in K$, path connectedness of $K$ gives $\gamma$ such that $\gamma\p{0} = z_0$ and $\gamma\p{1} = z$, and so we get a sequence $\set{B\p{z_{n_k}, R_{n_k}}}_{1 \leq k \leq M}$ such that $z_0 \in B\p{z_{n_0}, R_{n_0}}$, $z \in B\p{z_{n_M}, R_{n_M}}$, and $B\p{z_{n_k}, R_{n_k}} \cap B\p{z_{n_{k+1}}, R_{n_{k+1}}} \neq \emptyset$. We may remove duplicates without breaking this property, so we have a strict subset of $A$.

Notice that if $w \in B\p{z_{n_k}, R_{n_k}} \cap B\p{z_{n_{k+1}}, R_{n_{k+1}}}$, then Harnack's inequality gives

$$
\begin{gathered}
    \frac{1}{3}u\p{z_{n_k}}
        = \frac{2R_{n_k} - R_{n_k}}{2R_{n_k} + R_{n_k}} u\p{z_{n_k}}
        \leq u\p{w}, \\
    u\p{w}
        \leq \frac{2R_{n_k} + R_{n_k}}{2R_{n_k} - R_{n_k}} u\p{z_{n_k}}
        = 3u\p{z_{n_{k+1}}},
\end{gathered}
$$

so $u\p{z_{n_k}} \leq 9u\p{z_{n_{k+1}}}$. Hence, by induction, we see

$$
u\p{z} \leq 3 \cdot 9^M u\p{z_0} \leq 3 \cdot 9^N u\p{z_0}.
$$

Let $C_K = 3 \cdot 9^N$. Since $z$ was arbitrary, we see

$$
\sup_{z \in K} u\p{z} \leq C_K u\p{z_0}.
$$

Similarly, $z_0$ was arbitrary, so

$$
\sup_{z \in K} u\p{z} \leq C_K \inf_{z \in K} u\p{z}.
$$
