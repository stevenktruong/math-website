Let us introduce a vector space $\mathcal{B}$ defined as follows,

$$
\mathcal{B} = \set{\func{u}{\C}{\C},\ u \text{ is holomorphic and } \iint_\C \abs{u\p{x + iy}}^2 e^{-\p{x^2+y^2}} \,\diff{x} \,\diff{y} < \infty}.
$$

Show that $\mathcal{B}$ becomes a _complete_ space when equipped with the norm

$$
\norm{u}^2 = \iint_\C \abs{u\p{x + iy}}^2 e^{-\p{x^2+y^2}} \,\diff{x} \,\diff{y}.
$$

Observe that $\mathcal{B}$ is the subspace of holomorphic functions in $L^2\p{\mu}$, where

$$
\mu\p{A} = \iint_A e^{-\p{x^2 + y^2}} \,\diff{x} \,\diff{y},
$$

which is a finite measure on $\C$. Note also that $0 \leq e^{-\p{x^2 + y^2}} \leq 1$. Since $\mathcal{B}$ is a subspace of a complete space, we only need to show that it is closed in $L^2$.

Suppose $\set{u_n}_n \subseteq \mathcal{B}$ is a sequence such that $u_n \to u$ in $L^2$. If we show that $u_n$ converges locally uniformly, then we're done.

Let $R > 0$ and let $K = \cl{B\p{0, R}}$. For each $z \in K$, we have

$$
u_n\p{z}
    = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{\partial B\p{z,r}} \frac{u_n\p{\zeta}}{\zeta - z} \,\diff\zeta
    = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} u_n\p{z + re^{i\theta}} \,\diff\theta,
$$

so taking absolute values, multiplying both sides by $r$ and integrating from $0$ to $1$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \abs{u_n\p{z}}
        &\leq \frac{1}{\pi} \iint_{B\p{z,1}} \abs{u_n\p{x + iy}} \,\diff{x} \,\diff{y} \\
        &= \frac{1}{\pi} \iint_{B\p{z,1}} \frac{\abs{u_n\p{x + iy}} e^{-\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}}{e^{-\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}} \,\diff{x} \,\diff{y} \\
        &= \frac{1}{\pi e^{\sqrt{R+1}}} \iint_{B\p{z,1}} \abs{u_n\p{x + iy}} e^{-\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} \,\diff{x} \,\diff{y} \\
        &\leq \frac{\mu\p{B\p{z, 1}}}{\pi e^{\sqrt{R+1}}} \p{\iint_\C \abs{u_n\p{x + iy}}^2 e^{-\p{x^2 + y^2}} \,\diff{x} \,\diff{y}}^{1/2}
            && \p{\text{Cauchy-Schwarz}} \\
        &\leq \frac{\mu\p{\C}}{\pi e^{\sqrt{R+1}}} \norm{u_n}_{L^2\p{\mu}}.
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, $\set{u_n}_n$ is uniformly bounded on $K$. Since any compact set is contained in a compact ball, we may apply Montel's theorem. Hence, we get a locally uniformly convergent subsequence $\set{u_{n_k}}_k$ on $\C$. Passing to another sequence if necessary, $\set{u_{n_k}}_k$ also converges almost everywhere to $u$, since it converges to $u$ in $L^2$. By local uniform convergence, $u$ must also be holomorphic, so $\mathcal{B}$ is a closed subspace of $L^2\p{\mu}$, hence complete.
