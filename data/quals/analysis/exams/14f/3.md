<problem>

Let $\set{f_n}_n$ be a bounded sequence in $L^2\p{\R}$ and suppose that $f_n \to 0$ Lebesgue almost everywhere. Show that $f_n \to 0$ in the weak topology on $L^2\p{\R}$.

<solution>

Let $g \in L^2\p{\R}$ and $\epsilon > 0$. Then there exists $R > 0$ such that

$$
\p{\int_{\abs{x}>R} \abs{g}^2 \,\diff{x}}^{1/2} < \epsilon
$$

since $\abs{g}^2$ is integrable. Also, $E \mapsto \int_E \abs{g}^2 \,\diff{x}$ defines a measure absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure, so there exists $\delta > 0$ such that if $m\p{E} < \delta$, then $\int_E \abs{g}^2 \,\diff{x} < \epsilon^2$.

On $\br{-R, R}$, which is a finite measure set, we may apply Egorov's theorem to get a measurable set $E \subseteq \br{-R, R}$ such that $m\p{E} < \delta$ and so that $f_n \to 0$ uniformly on $\br{-R, R} \setminus E$. Thus, if $M = \sup_n \norm{f_n}_{L^2}$ and $n$ is large enough, we have $\abs{f_n} \leq \epsilon$ on $\br{-R, R} \setminus E$ and so by Cauchy-Schwarz,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \abs{\int_\R f_ng \,\diff{x}}
        &\leq \int_{\br{-R,R} \setminus E} \abs{f_ng} \,\diff{x} + \int_E \abs{f_ng} \,\diff{x} + \int_{\set{\abs{x}>R}} \abs{f_ng} \,\diff{x} \\
        &\leq \p{\int_{\br{-R,R} \setminus E} \abs{f_n}^2 \,\diff{x}}^{1/2} \norm{g}_{L^2} + \norm{f_n}_{L^2}\p{\int_E \abs{g}^2 \,\diff{x}}^{1/2} + \norm{f_n}_{L^2}\p{\int_{\set{\abs{x}>R}} \abs{g}^2 \,\diff{x}}^{1/2} \\
        &\leq \norm{g}_{L^2}\epsilon + M\epsilon + M\epsilon.
\end{aligned}
$$

Sending $\epsilon \to 0$, we get the claim.
