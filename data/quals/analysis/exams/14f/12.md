<problem>

Let $\Omega = \set{z \in \C \mid \abs{z} > 1}$. Suppose $\func{u}{\cl{\Omega}}{\R}$ is bounded and continuous on $\cl{\Omega}$ and that it is subharmonic on $\Omega$. Prove the following: if $u\p{z} \leq 0$ for all $\abs{z} = 1$ then $u\p{z} \leq 0$ for all $z \in \Omega$.

<solution>

Let $\epsilon > 0$ and consider $v_\epsilon\p{z} = u\p{z} + \epsilon\log\,\abs{\frac{1}{z}}$, which is subharmonic as a sum of two subharmonic functions ($\log{\abs{\frac{1}{z}}}$ is harmonic away from $0$). Observe that because $u$ is bounded by, say, $M > 0$,

$$
v_\epsilon\p{z} \leq M + \epsilon\log\,\abs{\frac{1}{z}} \xrightarrow{\abs{z}\to\infty} -\infty.
$$

Thus, let $R > 0$ be big enough so that $v_\epsilon\p{z} \leq 0$ on $\abs{z} \geq R$. Notice also that $v_\epsilon\p{z} = u\p{z} \leq 0$ on $\abs{z} = 1$, so because $v_\epsilon$ is subharmonic on the annulus $\set{1 < \abs{z} < R}$, the maximum principle tells us that $v_\epsilon\p{z} \leq 0$ on all of $\Omega$. Since $\epsilon$ was arbitrary, sending $\epsilon \to 0$, we see that $u\p{z} \leq 0$ on all of $\Omega$, which completes the proof.
