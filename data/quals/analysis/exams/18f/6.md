Let $f \in L^2\p{\R}$ and assume the Fourier transform satisfies $\abs{\hat{f}\p{\xi}} > 0$ for Lebesgue almost every $\xi \in \R$. Prove that the set of finite linear combinations of the translates $f_y\p{x} = f\p{x - y}$ is norm dense in $L^2\p{\R}$.

<solution>

Suppose there exists $g \in L^2$ such that

$$
\int_\R g\p{x}\conj{f\p{x - y}} \,\diff{x}
    = \inner{g, f_y}
    = 0
$$

for all $y \in \R$. Let $\tilde{f}\p{x} = \conj{f\p{-x}}$. Then

$$
\p{\tilde{f} * g}\p{y}
    = \int_\R \tilde{f}\p{y - x}g\p{x} \,\diff{x}
    = \int_\R g\p{x} \conj{f\p{x - y}} \,\diff{x}
    = 0,
$$

by assumption. Thus $h = \tilde{f} * g = 0$, so

$$
\hat{h}\p{\xi}
    = \hat{\tilde{f}}\p{\xi} g\p{\xi}
    = 0,
$$

where

$$
\hat{\tilde{f}}\p{\xi}
    = \int_\R e^{-ix\xi} \conj{f\p{-x}} \,\diff{x}
    = \conj{\int_\R e^{-ix\xi} f\p{x} \,\diff{x}}
    = \conj{\hat{f}\p{\xi}},
$$

so

$$
\conj{\hat{f\p{\xi}}} g\p{\xi} = 0
$$

everywhere. Since $f\p{\xi} \neq 0$ almost everywhere, it follows that $g\p{\xi} = 0$ almost everywhere. Thus, because the Fourier-Plancherel transform is an isometry on $L^2$, it follows that $g = 0$ almost everywhere, so the translates are dense.
