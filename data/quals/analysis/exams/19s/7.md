<problem>

Let $\func{f}{\C}{\C}$ be entire non-constant, and let us set

$$
T\p{r}
    = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \log_+\abs{f\p{re^{i\phi}}} \,\diff\phi.
$$

Here $\log_+\p{s} = \max\,\set{\log{s}, 0}$. Show that $T\p{r} \to \infty$ as $r \to \infty$.

<solution>

Since $f$ is non-constant, there exists $n \geq 0$ such that $g\p{z} = \frac{f\p{z}}{z^n}$ is entire and $g\p{0} \neq 0$. Then by subharmonicity,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \log\,\abs{g\p{0}}
        &\leq \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \log\,\abs{g\p{re^{i\theta}}} \,\diff\theta \\
        &\leq \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \log\,\abs{f\p{re^{i\theta}}} \,\diff\theta - n\log{r} \\
        &\leq T\p{r} - n\log{r}.
\end{aligned}
$$

Suppose $T\p{r}$ is bounded. Then if $n \neq 0$, we may send $r \to \infty$ to get $\log\,\abs{g\p{0}} = -\infty$, which would imply that $g\p{0} = 0$, which is impossible. Thus, $f\p{0} \neq 0$ to begin with. In this case, we may apply Jensen's formula to get

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \log\,\abs{f\p{0}} + \sum_{r < \abs{a_n} < 3r} \log{3}
        &\leq \log\,\abs{f\p{0}} + \sum_{\abs{a_n} < 3r} \log\,\frac{3r}{\abs{a_n}} \\
        &= \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \log\,\abs{f\p{3re^{i\theta}}} \,\diff\theta \\
        &\leq T\p{3r},
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\set{a_n}_n$ are the zeroes of $f$. If $f$ only has finitely roots, then $f$ is a polynomial, so the sum has finitely many terms which grow like $\log{r}$, which is impossible since $T\p{r}$ is bounded. Finally, if $f$ has infinitely many zeroes, than the sum will diverge, since each term in the sum is strictly larger than $1$. Hence, in all cases, we get a contradiction, so $T\p{r}$ must be unbounded.
