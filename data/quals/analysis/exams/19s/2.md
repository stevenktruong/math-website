Let $\mu$ be a Borel probability measure on $\br{0, 1}$ that has no atoms (this means that $\mu\p{\set{t}} = 0$ for any $t \in \br{0, 1}$). Let also $\mu_1, \mu_2, \ldots$ be Borel probability measures on $\br{0, 1}$. Assume that $\mu_n$ converges to $\mu$ in the weak-\* topology. Denote $F\p{t} = \mu\p{\br{0, t}}$ and $F_n\p{t} = \mu_n\p{\br{0, t}}$ for each $n \geq 1$ and $t \in \br{0, 1}$. Prove that $F_n$ converges uniformly to $F$.

Let $\set{f_n}_n, \set{g_n}_n$ be continuous functions such that $f_n \leq \chi_{\br{0,t}} \leq g_n$ for all $n$ and so that $f_n$ increases to $\chi_{\pco{0,t}}$ and $g_n$ decreases to $\chi_{\br{0,t}}$ by taking piecewise linear functions. Then

$$
\begin{gathered}
    \int f_k \,\diff\mu_n
        \leq \mu_n\p{\br{0, t}}
        \leq \int f_k \,\diff\mu \\
    \implies
    \int f_k \,\diff\mu
        \leq \liminf_{n\to\infty} \mu_n\p{\br{0,t}}
        \leq \limsup_{n\to\infty} \mu_n\p{\br{0,t}}
        \leq \int g_k \,\diff\mu,
\end{gathered}
$$

by weak-\* convergence. We can then apply monotone convergence on the left-most integral and dominated convergence on the right-most integral to get

$$
\mu\p{\pco{0, t}}
        \leq \liminf_{n\to\infty} \mu_n\p{\br{0,t}}
        \leq \limsup_{n\to\infty} \mu_n\p{\br{0,t}}
        \leq \mu\p{\br{0, t}}.
$$

Since $\mu$ has no atoms, these are all equalities, so $F_n$ converges pointwise to $F$. To prove pointwise convergence, let $\epsilon > 0$. Since $F$ is continuous, it is uniformly continuous, so let $\delta > 0$ be as in the definition of uniform continuity. Then by compactness, there exist $0 = t_0 < t_1 < \cdots < t_N = 1$ such that the $B\p{t_i, \delta}$ cover $\br{0, 1}$. By pointwise convergence, there exists $M \in \N$ such that for $n > M$, $\abs{F_n\p{t_i} - F\p{t_i}} < \epsilon$ for all $1 \leq i \leq N$. Thus, given $t \in \br{0, 1}$, there exists $i$ such that $t \in \br{t_i, t_{i+1}}$, and so by monotonicity of every function,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \abs{F_n\p{t} - F\p{t}}
        &\leq \abs{F_n\p{t} - F_n\p{t_i}} + \abs{F_n\p{t_i} - F\p{t_i}} + \abs{F\p{t_i} - F\p{t}} \\
        &\leq F_n\p{t} - F_n\p{t_i} + 2\epsilon \\
        &\leq F_n\p{t_{i+1}} - F_n\p{t_i} + \p{F\p{t_{i+1}} - F\p{t_i}} + 2\epsilon \\
        &\leq \abs{F_n\p{t_{i+1}} - F\p{t_{i+1}}} + \abs{F_n\p{t_i} - F\p{t_i}} + 2\epsilon \\
        &\leq 4\epsilon,
\end{aligned}
$$

so the convergence is uniform.
