Suppose $\func{f}{\C}{\C}$ is a holomorphic function such that the function $z \mapsto g\p{z} = f\p{z} f\p{1/z}$ is bounded on $\C \setminus \set{0}$.

1. Show that if $f\p{0} \neq 0$, then $f$ is constant.
2. Show that if $f\p{0} = 0$, then there exist $n \in \N$ and $a \in \C$ such that $f\p{z} = az^n$ for all $z \in \C$.

1. By continuity, we have $\abs{f\p{z}} \geq \frac{1}{2}\abs{f\p{0}}$ if $\abs{z} < \delta$, for some $\delta > 0$. Let $M$ be an upper bound of $g$ so that

    $$
    \abs{f\p{1/z}}
        \leq \frac{2M}{\abs{f\p{0}}}
    $$

    near $0$. But this implies that $f\p{z}$ is bounded as $\abs{z} \to \infty$, so by Liouville's theorem, $f$ must be constant.

2. If $f$ is identically zero, then the claim is true with $a = 0$. Otherwise, there exists some $n \in \N$ such that $h\p{z} = \frac{f\p{z}}{z^n}$ is entire with $h\p{0} \neq 0$. Thus,

    $$
    g\p{z}
        = \frac{f\p{z}}{z^n} \cdot z^nf\p{1/z}
        = h\p{z} h\p{1/z}.
    $$

    By (1), it follows that $h$ is constant, i.e., there exists $a \in \C$ so that

    $$
    h\p{z} = a
    \implies f\p{z} = az^n,
    $$

    as required.
