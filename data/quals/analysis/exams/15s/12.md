<problem>

Find all entire functions $\func{f}{\C}{\C}$ that obey

$$
f'\p{z}^2 + f\p{z}^2 = 1.
$$

Prove that your list is exhaustive.

<solution>

Notice that

$$
\p{f'\p{z} + if\p{z}}\p{f'\p{z} - if\p{z}} = 1,
$$

so neither factors may vanish. Thus, $f' + f$ admits a logarithm, i.e., there exists an entire function $g$ such that

$$
e^{g\p{z}} = f'\p{z} + if\p{z}.
$$

We also get

$$
e^{g\p{z}}\p{f'\p{z} - if\p{z}} = 1
\implies f'\p{z} - if\p{z} = e^{-g\p{z}}.
$$

If $h\p{z} = \frac{g\p{z}}{i}$, then $g\p{z} = ih\p{z}$, so $e^{ih\p{z}} = f'\p{z} + if\p{z}$. This implies

$$
f\p{z} = \sin{h\p{z}}
\quad\text{and}\quad
f'\p{z} = \cos{h\p{z}}.
$$

Taking derivatives,

$$
f'\p{z} = h'\p{z}\cos{h\p{z}} = h'\p{z}f'\p{z}
\implies f'\p{z}\p{1 - h'\p{z}} = 0.
$$

If $f$ is constant, then $f\p{z}^2 = 1$, so $f\p{z} = 1$ or $f\p{z} = -1$, identically. Otherwise, we see that $f'\p{z}$ is zero only on an isolated set, which means that $h'\p{z} = 1$ except possibly on an isolated set. But by continuity, it follows that $h'\p{z} = 1$ everywhere, so $h\p{z} = z + c$ for some constant $c$.

In summary, if $f$ is constant, then $f\p{z} = 1$ or $f\p{z} = -1$. Otherwise, $f\p{z} = \cos\p{z + c}$ for some constant $c$, which completes the proof.
