Let $\Omega = \C \setminus \poc{-\infty, 0}$ and let $\log{z}$ be the branch of the complex logarithm on $\Omega$ that is real on the positive real axis (and analytic throughout $\Omega$). Show that for $0 < t < \infty$, the number of solutions $z \in \Omega$ to

$$
\log{z} = \frac{t}{z}
$$

is finite and independent of $t$.

We will use polar coordinates: $z = re^{i\theta}$ with $\theta \in \p{-\pi, \pi}$, which transforms the equation into

$$
\log{r} + i\theta
    = \frac{t}{r}\p{\cos\theta - i\sin\theta}.
$$

First, if we equate the imaginary parts, we get

$$
\theta = -\frac{t\sin\theta}{r}.
$$

Since $r, t > 0$, we see that if $\theta \neq 0$, then the left-hand side and right-hand side have different signs. Thus, the only possible roots occur with $\theta = 0$. For the real parts, at $\theta = 0$ we have

$$
\log{r} = \frac{t}{r}
\iff f\p{r} \coloneqq \log{r} - \frac{t}{r} = 0.
$$

Observe that

$$
f'\p{t}
    = \frac{1}{r} + \frac{t}{r^2}
    = \frac{r + t}{r^2} > 0,
$$

so $f$ is injective on $\p{0, \infty}$. Since $f\p{r} \to \infty$ as $r \to \infty$ and if $0 < r < 1$, then $f\p{r} < 0$. Hence, by the mean value theorem, $f\p{r}$ has a root and by injectivity, this root is unique. Thus, the number of solutions to the equation is precisely $1$ for any $t > 0$.
