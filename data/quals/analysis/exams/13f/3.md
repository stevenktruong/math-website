Does there exist a holomorphic function $\func{f}{\D}{\C}$ such that

$$
\lim_{n\to\infty} \abs{f\p{z_n}} = \infty
$$

for all sequences $\set{z_n}_n$ in $\D$ with $\lim_{n\to\infty} \abs{z_n} = 1$? Justify your answer!

Suppose $f$ is such a function. Certainly $f$ is non-constant, since it is unbounded near the boundary. For each $z_0 \in \partial\D$, we $\delta_{z_0} > 0$ such that if $\abs{z - z_0} < \delta_{z_0}$, then $\abs{f\p{z}} \geq 1$, since $f$ is unbounded on the boundary. By compactness, there exist $z_1, \ldots, z_n \in \partial\D$ such that $\set{B\p{z_k, \delta_{z_k}} \mid 1 \leq k \leq n}$ covers $\partial\D$. Thus, if we let $\delta = \max_{1 \leq k \leq n} \delta_{z_k}$, then

$$
\partial\D \subseteq \bigcup_{k=1}^n B\p{z_k, \delta}.
$$

Hence, the zeroes of $f$ are contained in the compact set $\cl{B\p{0, 1 - \delta}}$. Since $f$ is non-constant, $f$ can only vanish at finitely many points, or else they accumulate $\cl{B\p{0, 1 - \delta}}$, which implies that $f$ is identically zero. Let $\set{a_1, \ldots, a_m}$ be the zeroes of $f$ with corresponding orders $\set{k_1, \ldots, k_m}$. Thus,

$$
f\p{z} = g\p{z}\prod_{j=1}^m \p{z - a_j}^{k_j},
$$

where $g$ vanishes nowhere on $\D$. Thus,

$$
\frac{1}{g\p{z}} = \frac{1}{f\p{z}} \prod_{j=1}^m \p{z - a_j}^{k_j}
$$

and sending $\abs{z} \to 1$ and noting that polynomials are bounded on $\cl{\D}$, we see that

$$
\lim_{\abs{z}\to1} \abs{\frac{1}{g\p{z}}} = 0.
$$

But $g$ vanishes nowhere, so $\frac{1}{g}$ is holomorphic in $\D$. By the maximum principle, this implies that $\frac{1}{g}$ is identically zero, which implies that $f$ is identically $\infty$, a contradiction. Thus, no $f$ could have existed to begin with.
