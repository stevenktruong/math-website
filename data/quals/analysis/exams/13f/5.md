Let $\set{f_n}_n$ be a sequence of holomorphic functions on $\D$ and suppose that

$$
\int_\D \abs{f_n\p{z}} \,\diff\lambda\p{z} \leq 1
$$

for all $n \in \N$, where $\diff\lambda$ denotes integration with respect to Lebesgue measure $\lambda$ on $\C$. Show that then there exists a subsequence $\set{f_{n_k}}_k$ that converges uniformly on all compact subsets of $\D$.

<solution>

Suppose $\cl{B\p{z, r}} \subseteq \D$. Then by the mean value property

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \abs{f_n\p{z}}
        &\leq \frac{1}{\pi r^2} \int_{B\p{z, r}} \abs{f_n\p{\zeta}} \,\diff\lambda\p{\zeta} \\
        &\leq \frac{1}{\pi r^2}.
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, if $K = \cl{B\p{0, R}}$ for $0 < R < 1$, then let $\delta = \frac{1}{2}d\p{K, \D^\comp} > 0$ so that $\cl{B\p{z, \delta}} \subseteq \D$ for any $z \in K$. Hence,

$$
\abs{f_n\p{z}}
    \leq \frac{1}{\pi \delta^2},
$$

so $\set{f_n}_n$ form a normal family. Thus, there exists a subsequence which converges locally uniformly on $\D$, which completes the proof.
