<problem>

Let $U$ and $V$ be open and connected sets in the complex plane $\C$, and $\func{f}{U}{\C}$ be a holomorphic function with $f\p{U} \subseteq V$. Suppose that $f$ is a proper map from $U$ to $V$, i.e., $f^{-1}\p{K} \subseteq U$ is compact, whenever $K \subseteq V$ is compact. Show that then $f$ is surjective.

<solution>

By the open mapping theorem, $f\p{U}$ is open. If $f\p{U}$ is also closed, then $f\p{U}$ is a non-empty open and closed set in the connected set $V$, so $f\p{U} = V$. Otherwise, there exists some $w_0 \in \cl{f\p{U}} \setminus f\p{U}$, so let $\set{w_n}_n \subseteq f\p{U}$ be a sequence which converges to $w_0$. Then $K = \set{w_n}_n \cup \set{w_0}$ is compact so by assumption, $f^{-1}\p{K}$ is compact as well. For each $n$, let $z_n \in U$ be such that $f\p{z_n} = w_n$, which exist by assumption, and by compactness, there exists a convergent subsequence $\set{z_{n_k}}_k$ which converges to some $z_0 \in U$. But by continuity, we get

$$
f\p{z_0} = \lim_{k\to\infty} f\p{z_{n_k}} = \lim_{k\to\infty} w_{n_k} = w_0 \notin f\p{U},
$$

a contradiction. Thus, no $w_0$ could have existed to begin with, so $f\p{U}$ was open and closed in $V$ to begin with.
