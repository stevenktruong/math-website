Consider the Hilbert space $\ell^2\p{\Z}$. Show that the Borel $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{N}$ on $\ell^2\p{\Z}$ associated to the norm topology agrees with the Borel $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{W}$ on $\ell^2\p{\Z}$ associated to the weak topology.

Since linear functionals are continuous with respect to the strong topology, the strong topology is finer than the weak topology, so $\mathcal{W} \subseteq \mathcal{N}$. It remains to show the other inclusion.

Notice that $\ell^2\p{\Z}$ is a separable metric space, so it is second countable. Thus, its topology is generated by open balls, so it suffices to show that norm-open balls are weakly open.

Let $F = \set{y \in \ell^2\p{\Z} \mid \norm{x - y}_{\ell^2} < r}$. Then we can realize $F$ as a preimage of $f\p{y} = \norm{x - y}^2$: $F = f^{-1}\p{\pco{0, r^2}}$. Notice that if $\set{e_n}_n$ is an orthonormal basis for $\ell^2\p{\Z}$, then by Parseval's identity,

$$
f\p{y}
    = \norm{x}^2 + \norm{y}^2 - 2\Re{\inner{x, y}}
    = \norm{x}^2 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \abs{\inner{y, e_n}}^2 - 2\Re{\inner{y, x}}.
$$

We see that $f$ is a limit of $\mathcal{W}$-measurable functions: $\norm{x}^2$ is a constant, $\abs{\inner{y, e_n}}$ is the absolute value of the (weakly-continuous) linear functional $\inner{\:\cdot\:, e_n}$, and $\Re{\inner{y, x}}$ is the real part of the (weakly-continuous) linear functional $\inner{\:\cdot\:, x}$. Thus, $f$ is $\mathcal{W}$-measurable, which implies that $F \in \mathcal{W}$ and so $\mathcal{N} \subseteq \mathcal{W}$, by definition of the Borel $\sigma$-algebra.
