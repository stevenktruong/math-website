<problem>

Let $\D = \set{z \in \C \mid \abs{z} < 1}$, and suppose that $f$ is a holomorphic function in the punctured open unit disk $\D^* = \D \setminus \set{0}$ such that

$$
\int_{\D^*} \abs{f\p{z}}^2 \,\diff\lambda\p{z} < \infty,
$$

where integration is with respect to $2$-dimensional Lebesgue measure $\lambda$. Show that $f$ has a holomorphic extension to the unit disk $\D$.

See quals::10f.12.md and apply Riemann's removable singularity theorem.
