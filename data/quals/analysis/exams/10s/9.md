Let

$$
A = \set{x \in \ell^2 \st \sum_{n\geq1} n\abs{x_n}^2 \leq 1}.
$$

1. Show that $A$ is compact in the $\ell^2$ topology.
2. Show that the mapping from $A$ to $\R$ defined by

    $$
    x \mapsto \int_0^{2\pi} \abs{\sum_{n\geq1} x_ne^{in\theta}} \frac{\diff\theta}{2\pi}
    $$

    achieves its maximum on $A$.

We will show that $A$ is complete and totally bounded.

Since $\ell^2$ is complete, it suffices to show that $A$ is closed. Let $\set{x^{\p{n}}}_n \subseteq A$ be a sequence which converges to some $x \in \ell^2$. By Fatou's lemma with summation viewed as integration with respect to the counting measure,

$$
\sum_{n\geq1} n\abs{x_n}^2
    \leq \liminf_{k\to\infty} \sum_{n\geq1} n\abs{x^{\p{k}}_n}
    \leq 1,
$$

so $x \in A$, which means $A$ is closed, hence complete.

To show that $A$ is totally bounded, let $\epsilon > 0$. For any $x \in A$ and $N \geq 1$,

$$
\sum_{n\geq N} \abs{x_n}^2
    \leq \sum_{n\geq N} N\abs{x_n}^2
    \leq \sum_{n\geq N} n\abs{x_n}^2
    \leq 1
\implies
\sum_{n\geq N} \abs{x_n}^2 \leq \frac{1}{N}.
$$

Pick $N$ large enough so that $\frac{1}{N} < \epsilon$. Observe that if $1 \leq n \leq N$, then $n\abs{x_n}^2 \leq 1$, so $x_n \in \br{-1, 1}$. Since $\br{-1, 1}$ is compact, there exist $z_1, \ldots, z_M \in \br{-1, 1}$ such that the $B\p{z_i, \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon}{N}}}$ cover $\br{-1, 1}$. Hence, given any $x \in B$, there exist $z_{i_1}, \ldots, z_{i_N}$ so that $\abs{z_{i_j} - x_j} < \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon}{N}}$, and so

$$
\sum_{n=1}^N \abs{x_n - z_{i_n}}^2 + \sum_{n>N} \abs{x_n}^2
    \leq \sum_{n=1}^N \frac{\epsilon}{N} + \frac{1}{N}
    \leq 2\epsilon.
$$

Thus, $A$ is totally bounded, hence compact.

1. It is enough to show the mapping, which we call $f$, is continuous on $\ell^2$, since $A$ is compact. First notice that

    $$
    \inner{e^{in\theta}, e^{im\theta}}
        = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} e^{in\theta}\conj{e^{im\theta}} \,\diff\theta
        =
            \begin{cases}
                0 & \text{if } n \neq m, \\
                1 & \text{if } n = m,
            \end{cases}
    $$

    i.e., $\set{e^{in\theta}}_n$ is an orthonormal set on $L^2\p{\br{0, 2\pi}}$ with respect to the normalized Lebesgue measure $\frac{\diff\theta}{2\pi}$. Thus,

    $$
    \norm{\sum_{n\geq1} x_ne^{in\theta}}_{L^2}^2
        = \sum_{n\geq1} x_n^2.
    $$

    By HÃ¶lder's inequality,

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
       \abs{f\p{x} - f\p{y}}
           &= \frac{1}{2\pi} \abs{\int_0^{2\pi} \abs{\sum_{n\geq1} x_ne^{in\theta}} - \abs{\sum_{n\geq1} y_ne^{in\theta}} \,\diff\theta} \\
           &\leq \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \abs{\sum_{n\geq1} \p{x_n - y_n}e^{in\theta}} \,\diff\theta \\
           &\leq \p{\int_0^{2\pi} \abs{\sum_{n\geq1} \p{x_n - y_n}e^{in\theta}}^2 \,\frac{\diff\theta}{2\pi}}^{1/2} \p{\int_0^{2\pi} \,\frac{\diff\theta}{2\pi}}^{1/2} \\
           &= \norm{\sum_{n\geq1} \p{x_n - y_n}e^{in\theta}}_{L^2} \\
           &= \sqrt{\sum_{n\geq1} \abs{x_n - y_n}^2}.
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    We have shown that $f$ is $1$-Lipschitz, hence continuous, which shows that $f$ attains its maximum on $A$.
