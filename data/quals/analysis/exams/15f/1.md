<problem>

Let $\set{g_n}_n$ be a sequence of measurable functions on $\R^d$, such that $\abs{g_n\p{x}} \leq 1$ for all $x$, and assume that $g_n \to 0$ almost everywhere. Let $f \in L^1\p{\R^d}$. Show that the sequence

$$
\p{f * g_n}\p{x} = \int f\p{x - y}g_n\p{y} \,\diff{y} \to 0
$$

uniformly on each compact subset of $\R^d$, as $n \to \infty$.

<solution>

Let $K$ be a compact set and $\epsilon > 0$. Since $f \in L^1\p{\R^d}$, there exists $h \in C_0\p{\R^d}$ such that $\norm{f - h}_{L^1} < \epsilon$ by density and regularity of the Lebesgue measure. Then if $E$ denotes the support of $h$ and $M$ the maximum of $H$, we have by HÃ¶lder's inequality for any $x \in K$

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \abs{\int f\p{x - y}g_n\p{y} \,\diff{y}}
        &\leq \abs{\int h\p{x - y}g_n\p{y} \,\diff{y}} + \int \abs{f\p{x - y} - h\p{x - y}}\abs{g_n\p{y}} \,\diff{y} \\
        &\leq \abs{\int_{x + E} h\p{x - y} g_n\p{y} \,\diff{y}} + \int \abs{f\p{x - y} - h\p{x - y}} \,\diff{y} \\
        &\leq M \int_{x + E} \abs{g_n\p{y}} \,\diff{y} + \norm{f - h}_{L^1}.
\end{aligned}
$$

Observe that because $K$ and $E$ are compact, there exists $R > 0$ such that $K + E \subseteq B\p{0, R}$, e.g., $R > \sup_K \abs{x} + \sup_E \abs{x}$. Hence, by dominated convergence ($1 \in L^1\p{B\p{0,R}}$), there exists $N \in \N$ such that

$$
\int_{B\p{0,R}} \abs{g_n\p{y}} \,\diff{y} < \epsilon
$$

for all $n \geq N$. Thus,

$$
\abs{\p{f * g_n}\p{x}}
    \leq M\epsilon + \epsilon,
$$

independent of $x$, which completes the proof.
