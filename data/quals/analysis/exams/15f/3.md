Let $f \in L^1_{\mathrm{loc}}\p{\R^d}$ be such that for some $0 < p < 1$, we have

$$
\abs{\int f\p{x} g\p{x} \,\diff{x}}
    \leq \p{\int \abs{g\p{x}}^p \,\diff{x}}^{1/p},
$$

for all $g \in C_0\p{\R^d}$. Show that $f\p{x} = 0$ a.e. Here $C_0\p{\R^d}$ is the space of continuous functions with compact support on $\R^d$.

Let $K$ be a compact set and $\epsilon > 0$. Since $K$ is bounded, there exists $R > 0$ such that $K \subseteq B\p{0, R}$. Since $f \in L^1\p{B\p{0, R}}$, the map $E \mapsto \int_{B\p{0, R} \cap E} \abs{f\p{x}} \,\diff{x}$ defines a measure absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure. Hence, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that if $m\p{E} < \delta$, then

$$
\int_{B\p{0, R} \cap E} \abs{f\p{x}} \,\diff{x} < \epsilon.
$$

By regularity of the Lebesgue measure, there exists an open set $K \subseteq U \subseteq B\p{0, R}$ such that $m\p{U \setminus K} < \delta$, and so $\int_{U \setminus K} \abs{f\p{x}} \,\diff{x} < \epsilon$. Shrinking $\delta$ further, we may assume that $\delta < \epsilon$. Hence,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \abs{\int_K f\p{x} \,\diff{x}}
        &= \abs{\int_K f\p{x}g\p{x} \,\diff{x}} \\
        &= \abs{\int_U f\p{x}g\p{x} \,\diff{x} - \int_{U \setminus K} f\p{x}g\p{x} \,\diff{x}} \\
        &\leq \abs{\int_U f\p{x}g\p{x} \,\diff{x}} + \int_{U \setminus K} \abs{f\p{x}} \,\diff{x} \\
        &\leq \p{\int \abs{g\p{x}}^p \,\diff{x}}^{1/p} + \epsilon \\
        &\leq m\p{U}^{1/p} + \epsilon \\
        &\leq \p{m\p{K} + \delta}^{1/p} + \epsilon \\
        &\leq \p{m\p{K} + \epsilon}^{1/p} + \epsilon.
\end{aligned}
$$

Sending $\epsilon \to 0$, we see that the given inequality also works when $g$ is the characteristic equation on a compact set. We will now emphasize the fact that $L^p$ does not satisfy the triangle inequality for $0 < p < 1$: let $Q$ be a cube with side length $L$, and for each $N \in \N$, decompose $Q$ into almost disjoint cubes $Q_n$ with side lengths $\frac{L}{N}$. Then

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \abs{\int f\p{x} \chi_Q\p{x} \,\diff{x}}
         \leq \sum_{n=1}^{N^d} \abs{\int f\p{x} \chi_{Q_n} \,\diff{x}}
        &\leq \sum_{n=1}^{N^d} m\p{Q_n}^{1/p} \\
        &= \sum_{n=1}^{N^d} \frac{L^d}{N^{d/p}} \\
        &= \frac{L^d}{N^{d\p{\frac{1}{p}-1}}}
            \xrightarrow{N\to\infty} 0,
\end{aligned}
$$

since $\frac{1}{p} - 1 > 0$. Indeed, since $0 < p < 1$, the right-hand side shrinks instead of growing as $N \to \infty$. Thus, we have shown that $\int_Q f\p{x} \,\diff{x} = 0$ for any cube. Hence, by the Lebesgue differentiation theorem, we see that $f\p{x} = 0$ almost everywhere.
