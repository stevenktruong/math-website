<problem>

Assume that $f\p{z}$ is an entire function that is $2\pi$-periodic in the sense that $f\p{z + 2\pi} = f\p{z}$, and

$$
\abs{f\p{x + iy}} \leq Ce^{\alpha\abs{y}},
$$

for some $C > 0$, where $0 < \alpha < 1$. Prove that $f$ is constant.

<solution>

Since $f$ is $2\pi$-periodic, we may write $f\p{z} = g\p{e^{iz}}$, where $g\p{z} = f\p{\frac{\log{z}}{i}}$. Indeed, by periodicity, $g$ is well-defined regardless of the branch chosen, and it is holomorphic except at the origin. When $\abs{z} < 1$, we get by assumption that

$$
\abs{g\p{z}}
    \leq Ce^{\alpha\abs{\log\abs{z}}}
    = Ce^{-\alpha\log\abs{z}}
    = C\abs{z}^{-\alpha},
$$

and because $0 < \alpha < 1$, we see that $\abs{zg\p{z}} \to 0$, so $g$ extends analytically to the origin, i.e., $g$ is entire. On the other hand, if $\abs{z} > 1$, $\abs{g\p{z}} \leq C\abs{z}^\alpha$. Hence, by the Cauchy estimates,

$$
\abs{g^{\p{n}}\p{z}}
    \leq \frac{CR^\alpha n!}{R^n}
    = \frac{Cn!}{R^{n-\alpha}}
    \xrightarrow{R\to\infty}
    0,
$$

since $n - \alpha \geq 1 - \alpha > 0$. Thus, $g$ is constant, which implies that $f$ is constant as well.
