<problem>

Consider the Banach space $V = C\p{\br{-1, 1}}$ of all real-valued continuous functions on $\br{-1, 1}$ equipped with the supremum norm defined as

$$
\norm{f} = \sup\,\set{\abs{f\p{x}} \mid x \in \br{-1, 1}} \quad\text{for } f \in V.
$$

Let $B = \set{f \in V \mid \norm{f} \leq 1}$ be the closed unit ball in $V$.

Show that there exists a bounded linear functional $\func{\Lambda}{V}{\R}$ such that $\Lambda\p{B}$ is an open subset of $\R$.

Define

$$
\Lambda\p{f} = \int_0^1 f \,\diff{x} - \int_{-1}^0 f \,\diff{x},
$$

i.e., $\Lambda$ is integration against the step function $\phi\p{x} = -1$ on $\pco{-1, 0}$ and $\phi\p{x} = 1$ on $\poc{0, 1}$. Then for $f \in B$,

$$
\abs{\Lambda\p{f}}
    \leq \int_0^1 \norm{f} \,\diff{x} + \int_{-1}^0 \norm{f} \,\diff{x}
    = 2.
$$

Since $B$ is connected (it is path-connected via the convex homotopy) and $\lambda$ is continuous, so $\lambda\p{B}$ is connected, i.e., an interval. For $\epsilon > 0$, let

$$
f\p{x}
    =
        \begin{cases}
            -1 & \text{if } -1 \leq x \leq -\epsilon \\
            \frac{x}{\epsilon} & \text{if } -\epsilon \leq x \leq \epsilon \\
            1 & \text{if } \epsilon \leq x \leq 1.
        \end{cases}
$$

Then $f$ is piecewise linear, hence continuous, and $\norm{f} = 1$. Also, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \Lambda\p{f}
        &= \int_{-1}^{-\epsilon} \,\diff{x} - \int_{-\epsilon}^0 \frac{x}{\epsilon} \,\diff{x} + \int_0^\epsilon \frac{x}{\epsilon} \,\diff{x} + \int_\epsilon^1 \,\diff{x} \\
        &= 1 - \epsilon + \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} + 1 - \epsilon \\
        &= 2 - \epsilon.
\end{aligned}
$$

Replacing $f$ with $-f$, we see that $\inf_B \Lambda = -2$ and $\sup_B \Lambda = 2$, so it remains to show that $\Lambda$ does not attain a maximum or minimum on $B$.

Suppose $\Lambda\p{f} = 2$. Then $f\p{x} = 1$ on $\poc{0, 1}$. Otherwise, if there exists $x_0 \in \poc{0, 1}$ such that $f\p{x_0} < 1$, then $f\p{x} \leq 1 - \epsilon < 1$ on an interval $I$ of length $\delta > 0$ on $\poc{0, 1}$, by continuity. Then

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \Lambda\p{f}
        &= \int_I f \,\diff{x} + \int_{\br{0,1} \setminus I} f \,\diff{x} - \int_{-1}^0 f \,\diff{x} \\
        &\leq \int_I f \,\diff{x} + \int_{\br{0,1} \setminus I} f \,\diff{x} + \int_{-1}^0 \,\diff{x} \\
        &\leq \p{1 - \epsilon}\delta + 1 - \delta + 1 \\
        &= 2 - \epsilon\delta \\
        &< 2.
\end{aligned}
$$

By symmetry, we need $f\p{x} = -1$ on $\pco{-1, 0}$, but this is impossible, as no value of $f\p{0}$ we take, $f$ cannot be continuous. Thus, $f$ does not attain its maximum, and by a similar argument, $f$ does not attain its minimum. Hence, $\Lambda\p{B} = \p{-2, 2}$, an open set.
