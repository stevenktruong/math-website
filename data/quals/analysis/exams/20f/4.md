<problem>

Let $X$ be a separable Banach space over $\R$ and let $\func{f}{X}{\R}$ be norm-continuous and convex. Suppose that a sequence $\set{x_n}_n$ in $X$ converges weakly to $x \in X$. Show that

$$
F\p{x}
    \leq \sup_n F\p{x_n}.
$$

<solution>

Let $a = \sup_n F\p{x_n}$, and consider $A = F^{-1}\p{\poc{-\infty, a}}$. Since $F$ is convex, it follows that $A$ is a convex set: if $y, z \in A$ and $t \in \br{0, 1}$, then

$$
F\p{ty + \p{1 - t}z}
    \leq tF\p{y} + \p{1 - t}F\p{z}
    \leq a,
$$

so $ty + \p{1 - t} \in A$. Since $F$ is norm-continuous, $A$ is also closed, so by the geometric Hahn-Banach, for any $y \notin A$, there exists $f \in X^*$ such that $f\p{y} < t \leq f\p{z}$ for any $z \in A$. Thus, $f^{-1}\p{\p{-\infty, t}} \subseteq A^\comp$ is an open neighborhood of $y$, so $A$ is weakly closed. Thus, because $x_n \in A$ and $x_n \to x$ weakly, it follows that $x \in A$, i.e.,

$$
F\p{x} \leq \sup_n F\p{x_n},
$$

which was what we wanted to show.
