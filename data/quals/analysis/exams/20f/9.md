<problem>

Consider the following region in the complex plane:

$$
\Omega = \set{x + iy \st 0 < x < \infty \text{ and } 0 < y < \frac{1}{x}}.
$$

Exhibit an explicit conformal mapping $f$ of $\Omega$ onto $\D$.

<solution>

Let $g\p{z} = z^2$ so that $g\p{x + iy} = x^2 - y^2 + 2ixy$. Since $\Omega$ is a subset of the upper half-plane, it follows that $g$ is a conformal map onto its image. We claim that $g\p{\Omega} = \set{x + iy \st 0 < y < 2}$. If $x + iy \in \Omega$, then by definition,

$$
0 < xy < 1
\implies 0 < \Im{g\p{x + iy}} = 2xy < 2.
$$

Conversely, given $x + iy$ with $0 < y < 2$, we need to solve

$$
a^2 - b^2 = x
\quad\text{and}\quad
2ab = y
$$

for $a + ib \in \Omega$. Observe that

$$
\begin{aligned}
    x
        = a^2 - b^2
        = a^2 - \frac{y^2}{4a^2}
    &\implies
        4a^4 - 4a^2x - y^2 = 0 \\
    &\implies
        a^2 = \frac{4x \pm \sqrt{16x^2 + 16y^2}}{8}.
\end{aligned}
$$

Since $a > 0$, we have

$$
a^2
    = \frac{x + \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}{2}
    > 0,
$$

so such an $a + ib$ exists in $\Omega$, and so $g$ maps $\Omega$ to a strip. Thus, $h\p{z} = e^{\pi z^2/2}$ maps $\Omega$ to the upper half-plane, so

$$
f\p{z}
    = \frac{h\p{z} - i}{h\p{z} + i}
    = \frac{e^{\pi z^2/2} - i}{e^{\pi z^2/2} + i}
$$

is the map we want.
