<problem>

Construct a non-constant entire function $f\p{z}$ such that the zeroes of $f$ are simple and coincide with the set of all (positive) natural numbers.

</problem>

<solution>

By the Weierstrass factorization theorem,

$$
f\p{z} = \prod_{n=1}^\infty E_1\p{\frac{z}{n}}
$$

works, where

$$
E_1\p{z} = e^z\p{1 - z}.
$$

We have the bound $\abs{1 - E_1\p{z}} \leq \abs{z}^2$ for $\abs{z} \leq 1$. Thus, on compact balls $\cl{B\p{0, R}}$, if $N \in \N$ is such that $N - 1 < R \leq N$, we have $\abs{\frac{z}{n}} \leq \frac{R}{N} \leq 1$ for $n \geq N$. Thus,

$$
\sum_{n=N}^\infty \abs{1 - E_1\p{z}}
    \leq \sum_{n=N}^\infty \p{\frac{R}{n}}^2
    = R^2 \sum_{n=N}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2}
    < \infty,
$$

so the product converges locally uniformly on compact sets, and so $f$ is an entire function with the specified zeroes.
