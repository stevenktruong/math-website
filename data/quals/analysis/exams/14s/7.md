<problem>

Characterize all entire functions $f$ with $\abs{f\p{z}} > 0$ for $\abs{z}$ large and

$$
\limsup_{z\to\infty}\,\frac{\abs{\log\,\abs{f\p{z}}}}{\abs{z}} < \infty.
$$

</problem>

<solution>

By definition, there exist $R, M > 0$ such that

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \frac{\abs{\log\,\abs{f\p{z}}}}{\abs{z}} \leq M
        &\implies \abs{\log\,\abs{f\p{z}}} \leq M\abs{z} \\
        &\implies \abs{f\p{z}} \leq e^{M\abs{z}}
\end{aligned}
$$

for $\abs{z} \geq R$. Since $\cl{B\p{0, R}}$ is compact, it follows that $f$ is entire of order $1$. Conversely, if $f$ is entire of order $1$, then $\abs{f\p{z}} \leq Ce^{a\abs{z}}$ for all $z \geq 1$. Thus,

$$
\frac{\abs{\log{\abs{f\p{z}}}}}{\abs{z}}
    \leq \frac{\log{C} + a\abs{z}}{\abs{z}}
\implies
\limsup_{z\to\infty}\,\frac{\abs{\log{\abs{f\p{z}}}}}{\abs{z}} \leq a < \infty,
$$

so all entire functions satisfying this property are entire of order $1$. Since $\abs{f\p{z}} > 0$ for $\abs{z}$ large, $f$ only has finitely many zeroes, so by Hadamard's theorem, $f$ has the form

$$
f\p{z} = e^{az+b} \prod_{n=1}^N \p{z - z_n},
$$

where the $z_n$ are the zeroes of $f$.
