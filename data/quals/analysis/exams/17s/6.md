<problem>

Let $\cl{\D}$ be the closed unit disc in the complex plane, let $\set{p_n}_n$ be distinct points in the open disc $\D$ and let $r_n > 0$ be such that the discs $D_n = \set{z \mid \abs{z - p_n} \leq r_n}$ satisfy

1. $D_n \subseteq \D$,
2. $D_n \cap D_m = \emptyset$ if $n \neq m$, and
3. $\sum r_n < \infty$.

Prove that $X = \cl{\D} \setminus \bigcup_n D_n$ has positive area.

_Hint:_ For $-1 < x < 1$ consider $\#\set{n \mid D_n \cap \set{\Re{z} = x} \neq \emptyset}$.

<solution>

Let $f\p{x} = \sum_n \chi_{\pi\p{D_n}}\p{x}$, where $\func{\pi}{\C}{\R}$, $z \mapsto \Re{z}$. Thus, $m\p{\pi\p{D_n}} = 2r_n$, where $m$ denotes the Lebesgue measure, and because each term in the sum is non-negative, the monotone convergence gives us

$$
\int_{-1}^1 f\p{x} \,\diff{x} = \sum_n 2r_n < \infty,
$$

so $f\p{x} < \infty$ for almost every $x \in \p{-1, 1}$. Fix such an $x$, so that

$$
f\p{x} = \abs{\set{n \mid D_n \cap \set{\Re{z} = 0} \neq \emptyset}} < \infty.
$$

Since the $D_n$ are disjoint, we see that $D_n \cap \set{\Re{z} = x}$ comprises of finitely many closed segments, which cannot be all of $\D \cap \set{\Re{z} = x}$, a non-closed segment. Since $\D \cap \set{\Re{z} = x}$ is an open segment, $E_x = \p{\D \cap \set{\Re{z} = x}} \setminus \bigcup_n D_n$ contains an open segment, hence of positive one-dimensional Lebesgue measure.

Thus, the function $\chi_{E_x}\p{y}$ has positive integral for almost every $x \in \p{-1, 1}$ and so

$$
\begin{aligned}
m\p{X}
    &= \int_{\cl{\D}} \chi_{\cl{D} \setminus \bigcup_n D_n}\p{x, y} \,\diff{A} \\
    &= \int_{-1}^1 \int_{-\sqrt{1-x^2}}^{\sqrt{1-x^2}} \chi_{\p{\cl{\D} \setminus \bigcup_n D_n} \cap \set{\Re{z} = x}}\p{y} \,\diff{y} \,\diff{x} \\
    &= \int_{-1}^1 \int_{-\sqrt{1-x^2}}^{\sqrt{1-x^2}} \chi_{E_x}\p{y} \,\diff{y} \,\diff{x} \\
    &> 0,
\end{aligned}
$$

as required.
