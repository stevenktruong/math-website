<problem>

Rigorously determine the infimum of

$$
\int_{-1}^1 \abs{P\p{x} - \abs{x}}^2 \,\diff{x}
$$

over all choices of polynomials $P \in \R\br{x}$ of degree not exceeding three.

<solution>

Viewing this problem in $L^2\p{\br{-1,1}}$, we see that we need to orthogonally project $\abs{x}$ onto the subspace spanned by $\set{1, x, x^2, x^3}$. By Gram-Schmidt, we see that

$$
\begin{aligned}
    e_0\p{x}
        &= 1 \\
    e_1\p{x}
        &= x \\
    e_2\p{x}
        &= x^2 - \frac{1}{3} \\
    e_3\p{x}
        &= x^3 - \frac{3}{5}x
\end{aligned}
$$

are orthogonal. By calculation, we also have

$$
\norm{e_k}_{L^2}^2
    = \frac{2}{2k + 1}.
$$

Thus, the orthogonal projection is given by

$$
P\p{x}
    = \sum_{k=0}^3 \inner{\abs{x}, e_k}e_k.
$$
