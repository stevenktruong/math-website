Let $\mathcal{F}_M$ be the set of functions holomorphic on $\D$ and continuous on $\cl{\D}$ that satisfy

$$
\int_0^{2\pi} \abs{f\p{e^{it}}} \,\diff{t}
    \leq M < \infty.
$$

Show that every sequence $\set{f_n}_n$ in $\mathcal{F}_M$ contains a subsequence that converges uniformly on compact subsets of $\D$.

It suffices to show that $\mathcal{F}_M$ is a normal family, i.e., uniformly bounded on each compact set. Let $0 < r < R < 1$ and $f \in \mathcal{F}_M$. Observe that $f_R\p{z} = f\p{Rz}$ is holomorphic on a neighborhood of $\cl{\D}$, so by the Cauchy integral formula, we have for any $z \in \cl{B\p{0, r}}$ that

$$
\begin{gathered}
    f_R\p{z}
        = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{\partial \D} \frac{f_R\p{\zeta}}{\zeta - z} \,\diff\zeta \\
    \implies
    \abs{f_R\p{z}}
        \leq \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{\abs{f_R\p{e^{i\theta}}}}{1 - r} \,\diff\theta.
\end{gathered}
$$

Notice that $f_R \to f$ everywhere on $\partial\D$ by continuity, so by uniform continuity on $\cl{\D}$, we may simply send $R \to 1$ to get

$$
\abs{f\p{z}}
    \leq \frac{1}{2\pi\p{1 - r}} \int_0^{2\pi} \abs{f\p{e^{i\theta}}} \,\diff\theta
    \leq \frac{M}{2\pi\p{1 - r}}.
$$

Since $f$ was arbitrary and the constant depends only on $r$, we see that $\mathcal{F}_M$ is a normal family, so any sequence has a subsequence which converges locally uniformly on $\D$.
