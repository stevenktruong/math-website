Let $f \in L^1\p{\C} \cap C^1\p{\C}$. Show that the integral

$$
u\p{z}
    = -\frac{1}{2\pi} \iint_\C \frac{f\p{\zeta}}{\zeta - z} \,\diff\lambda\p{\zeta},
\quad z \in \C,
$$

defines a $C^1$ function on the whole complex plane that satisfies

$$
\p{\pder{}{x} + i\pder{}{y}}u\p{x + iy}
    = f\p{x + iy}.
$$

In this problem, $\diff\lambda\p{\zeta}$ denotes (planar) Lebesgue measure on $\C$ and $C^1$ is meant in the real-variable sense.

Recall that by an application of Green's theorem, we have for any $g \in C_{\mathrm{c}}^1\p{\C}$ that

$$
g\p{z} = -\frac{1}{\pi} \iint_\C \pder{g}{\conj{\zeta}}\p{\zeta} \frac{1}{\zeta - z} \,\diff\lambda\p{\zeta}.
$$

To extend this to our $f$, let $\set{K_n}_n$ be a compact exhaustion of $\C$, e.g., $K_n = \cl{B\p{0, n}}$. Let $\set{\phi_n}_n \in C_{\mathrm{c}}^1\p{\C}$ be a bump function on $K_n$, i.e., $0 \leq \phi_n \leq 1$ and $\phi_n = 1$ on a neighborhood of $K_n$. Let $\psi_1 = \phi_1$ and $\psi_n = \phi_n - \phi_{n-1}$ for $n \geq 2$ so that $\psi_n$ is $0$ on a neighborhood of $K_{n-1}$. Since $K_n \subseteq K_{n+1}$ for each $n$, it follows that this sum is locally finite. Hence, at $z \in K_N$, we have

$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \psi_n\p{z}
    = \phi_1\p{z} + \sum_{n=2}^N \p{\phi_n\p{z} - \phi_{n-1}\p{z}}
    = \phi_N\p{z}
    = 1,
$$

so $\set{\psi_n}_n$ is a locally finite partition of unity. Thus,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    u\p{z}
        &= -\frac{1}{2\pi} \iint_\C \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\psi_n\p{\zeta}f\p{\zeta}}{\zeta - z} \,\diff\lambda\p{\zeta} \\
        &= -\frac{1}{2\pi} \iint_\C \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\psi_n\p{\zeta + z}f\p{\zeta + z}}{\zeta} \,\diff\lambda\p{\zeta}
            && \p{\zeta \mapsto \zeta - z} \\
        &= -\frac{1}{2\pi} \sum_{n=1}^\infty \iint_\C \frac{\psi_n\p{\zeta + z}f\p{\zeta + z}}{\zeta} \,\diff\lambda\p{\zeta},
\end{aligned}
$$

since after the change of variables, the sum is finite for each $z \in \C$. Again by local finiteness, because $\psi_n, f$ are $C^1$, it follows that $u$ is also $C^1$. Similarly, local finiteness allows us to interchange the derivative and the sum, and because $f \in L^1\p{\C}$ and each $\psi_n$ is compactly supported, we may differentiate under the integral sign and apply change of variables freely:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \pder{u}{\conj{z}}\p{z}
        &= -\frac{1}{\pi} \sum_{n=1}^\infty \pder{}{\conj{z}} \iint_\C \frac{\psi_n\p{\zeta + z}f\p{\zeta + z}}{\zeta} \,\diff\lambda\p{\zeta} \\
        &= -\frac{1}{\pi} \sum_{n=1}^\infty \iint_\C \pder{\p{\psi_nf}}{\conj{\zeta}}\p{\zeta + z} \frac{1}{\zeta} \,\diff\lambda\p{\zeta} \\
        &= -\frac{1}{\pi} \sum_{n=1}^\infty \iint_\C \pder{\p{\psi_nf}}{\conj{\zeta}}\p{\zeta} \frac{1}{\zeta - z} \,\diff\lambda\p{\zeta}
            && \p{\zeta \mapsto \zeta + z} \\
        &= \sum_{n=1}^\infty \psi_n\p{z} f\p{z}
            && \p{\psi_n f \in C_{\mathrm{c}}^1} \\
        &= f\p{z},
\end{aligned}
$$

since we had a partition of unity.
