<problem>

Fix $f \in L^1\p{\R}$. Show that

$$
\lim_{n\to\infty} \int_0^2 f\p{x} \sin\p{x^n} \,\diff{x} = 0.
$$

</problem>

<solution>

Notice that on $\pco{0, 1}$, we have $\sin\p{x^n} \to 0$, and we also have $\abs{f\p{x}\sin\p{x^n}} \leq \abs{f\p{x}} \in L^1\p{\R}$, so by dominated convergence,

$$
\lim_{n\to\infty} \int_0^1 f\p{x} \sin\p{x^n} \,\diff{x} = 0.
$$

Hence, it suffices to show that the integral on $\br{1, 2}$ vanishes. By linearity of the problem and density of step functions in $L^1\p{\R}$, it suffices to prove this for $f = \chi_{\br{a,b}}$ with $1 \leq a \leq b \leq 2$. Integrating by parts, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \int_a^b \sin\p{x^n} \,\diff{x}
        &= \int_a^b \frac{1}{nx^{n-1}} \deriv{}{x} \p{-\cos\p{x^n}} \,\diff{x} \\
        &= \left. -\frac{\cos\p{x^n}}{nx^{n-1}} \right\rvert_a^b - \frac{n - 1}{n} \int_a^b \frac{\cos\p{x^n}}{x^{n-1}} \,\diff{x}.
\end{aligned}
$$

Notice that the first term is bounded by

$$
\frac{1}{na^{n-1}} + \frac{1}{nb^{n-1}}
    \xrightarrow{n\to\infty} 0,
$$

and for the second term, the integrand is bounded by $\frac{1}{a^{n-1}} \in L^1\p{\br{0,1}}$ and tends to $0$ for almost every $x \in \br{a, b}$. Hence, by dominated convergence, the integral tends to $0$ as well, so overall,

$$
\lim_{n\to\infty} \int_a^b \sin\p{x^n} \,\diff{x} = 0,
$$

as desired.
