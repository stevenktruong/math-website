Let $u$ be a continuous subharmonic function on $\C$ that satisfies

$$
\limsup_{\abs{z}\to\infty} \frac{u\p{z}}{\log\,\abs{z}} \leq 0.
$$

Show that $u$ is constant on $\C$.

<solution>

Let $\epsilon > 0$, and observe that if we set $u_\epsilon\p{z} = u\p{z} - \epsilon\log\,\abs{z}$, then $u_\epsilon$ is still subharmonic and

$$
u_\epsilon\p{z}
    = \p{\frac{u\p{z}}{\log\,\abs{z}} - \epsilon}\log\,\abs{z}
    \leq 0
$$

for $\abs{z} \geq R$ for some $R > 0$, by assumption. Thus, by the maximum principle, it follows that $u_\epsilon\p{z} \leq 0$ on $\abs{z} \leq R$, hence on all of $\C$. Sending $\epsilon \to 0$, we see that $u\p{z} \leq 0$ on $\C$. Thus,

$$
\limsup_{\abs{z}\to\infty} u_\epsilon\p{z} = -\infty,
$$

so by the maximum principle applied to a large annular region, we see that $u_\epsilon\p{z}$ must attain its maximum in $\partial\D$. Thus, by the maximum principle applied to the unit disk,

$$
\sup_{\abs{z} \geq 1} u_\epsilon\p{z}
    = \sup_{z \in \partial\D} u_\epsilon\p{z}
    = \sup_{z \in \partial\D} u\p{z}
    = \sup_{z \in \D} u\p{z},
$$

since $u$ and $u_\epsilon$ agree on $\partial\D$. Hence, for $\abs{z} \geq 1$,

$$
u\p{z}
    = u_\epsilon\p{z} + \epsilon\log\,\abs{z}
    \leq \sup_{z \in \D} u\p{z} + \epsilon\log\,\abs{z}.
$$

Sending $\epsilon \to 0$ again, we see that $u\p{z}$ must attain its maximum in $\cl{\D}$ by continuity, so by the maximum principle again, $u$ must be constant.
