Prove that $L^\infty\p{\R^n} \cap L^3\p{\R^n}$ is a Borel subset of $L^3\p{\R^n}$. Let $F_N = \set{f \in L^3\p{\R^n} \st \norm{f}_{L^\infty} \leq N}$. Then

$$
L^\infty\p{\R^n} \cap L^3\p{\R^n}
    = \bigcup_{N=1}^\infty F_N,
$$

so it suffices to show that each $F_N$ is closed. Suppose $\set{f_k}_k \subseteq F_N$ converges to $f$ in $L^3\p{\R^n}$. Then passing to a subsequence, we may assume that $f_k \to f$ pointwise almost everywhere. Observe then that

$$
\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty \set{x \in \R^n \st \abs{f\p{x}} \leq N} \cup \set{x \in \R^n \st f_k\p{x} \to f\p{x}}
$$

is a full measure set as a countable union of full measure sets. In other words, for almost every $x \in \R^n$, we have

$$
\abs{f\p{x}}
    \leq \sup_k \abs{f_k\p{x}}
    \leq N,
$$

so $f \in F_N$, which was what we wanted to show.
