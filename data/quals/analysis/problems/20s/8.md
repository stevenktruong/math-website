<problem>

For each $z \in \C$, let

$$
F\p{z} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \p{-1}^n \frac{\p{z/2}^{2n}}{\p{n!}^2}.
$$

1. Show that $F$ is an entire function and satisfies $\abs{F\p{z}} \leq e^{\abs{z}}$.
2. Show that there is an infinite collection of numbers $a_n \in \C$ so that

    $$
    F\p{z} = \prod_{n=1}^\infty \p{1 - \frac{z^2}{a_n^2}}
    $$

    and the product converges uniformly on compact subsets of $\C$.

1. First, observe that $2^{2n}\p{n!}^2 \geq \p{2n}!$, so

    $$
    \abs{F\p{z}}
        \leq \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{\abs{z}^{2n}}{2^{2n}\p{n!}^2}
        \leq \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{\abs{z}^{2n}}{\p{2n}!}
        \leq \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{\abs{z}^n}{n!}
        = e^{\abs{z}}.
    $$

    Hence, the sum converges absolutely on compact sets, so $F$ is entire.

2. Notice that $F$ is even, so if $a$ is a root of $F$, then so is $-a$. Also, $F\p{0} = 1 \neq 0$. Since $F$ is entire of order at most $1$, we have the following Hadamard factorization, where $\set{-a_n, a_n}_n$ are the roots of $F$:

    $$
    F\p{z}
        = e^{az+b} \prod_{n=1}^\infty \p{1 - \frac{z^2}{a_n^2}},
    $$

    and the product converges locally uniformly. Next, notice that

    $$
    F\p{0} = 1
    \implies e^b = 1.
    $$

    Since $F$ is even, we have

    $$
    1
        = \frac{F\p{z}}{F\p{-z}}
        = \frac{e^{az}}{e^{-az}}
        = e^{2az},
    $$

    so $a = 0$. Hence,

    $$
    F\p{z} = \prod_{n=1}^\infty \p{1 - \frac{z^2}{a_n^2}},
    $$

    which was what we wanted to show.
