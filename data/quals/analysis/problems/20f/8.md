<problem>

Let $\func{f}{\D}{\D}$ be holomorphic and satisfy $f\p{\frac{1}{2}} = f\p{-\frac{1}{2}} = 0$. Show that

$$
\abs{f\p{0}} \leq \frac{1}{4}.
$$

<solution>

For $a \in \D$, let $\func{\phi_a}{\D}{\D}$ be the automorphism of the disk

$$
\phi_a\p{z} = \frac{z - a}{1 - \conj{a}z}.
$$

Then because $f$ has zeroes at $\frac{1}{2}$ and $-\frac{1}{2}$, $g\p{z} = \frac{f\p{z}}{\phi_{1/2}\p{z}\phi_{-1/2}\p{z}}$ is holomorphic. Hence, by the maximum principle, we see that $\abs{g\p{z}} \leq 1$ on $\D$, and so

$$
\abs{\frac{f\p{z}}{\phi_{1/2}\p{z}\phi_{-1/2}\p{z}}}
    \leq 1
\implies
\abs{f\p{0}}
    \leq \abs{\phi_{1/2}\p{0}}\abs{\phi_{-1/2}\p{0}}
    = \frac{1}{4},
$$

which was what we wanted to show.
