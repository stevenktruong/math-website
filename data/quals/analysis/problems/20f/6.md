<problem>

Prove that the following inequality is valid for all odd $C^1$ functions $\func{f}{\br{-1,1}}{\R}$:

$$
\int_{-1}^1 \abs{f\p{x}}^2 \,\diff{x}
    \leq \int_{-1}^1 \abs{f'\p{x}}^2 \,\diff{x}.
$$

By odd, we mean that $f\p{-x} = -f\p{x}$.

<solution>

Notice that because $f$ is odd, we immediately have $f\p{0} = 0$. By the fundamental theorem of calculus and Cauchy-Schwarz,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \int_{-1}^1 \abs{f\p{x}}^2 \,\diff{x}
        &= \int_{-1}^1 \p{\int_0^x f'\p{t} \,\diff{t}}^2 \,\diff{x} \\
        &\leq \int_{-1}^1 \p{\int_{-1}^1 \chi_{\br{0,x}} \,\diff{t}} \p{\int_{-1}^1 \abs{f'\p{t}}^2 \,\diff{t}} \,\diff{x} \\
        &\leq \p{\int_{-1}^1 \abs{x} \,\diff{x}} \p{\int_{-1}^1 \abs{f'\p{t}}^2 \,\diff{t}} \\
        &= \int_{-1}^1 \abs{f'\p{x}}^2 \,\diff{x}.
\end{aligned}
$$
