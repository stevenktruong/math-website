<problem>

Let $\diff\mu_n$ be a sequence of probability measures on $\br{0, 1}$ so that

$$
\int f\p{x} \,\diff\mu_n\p{x}
$$

converges for every continuous function $\func{f}{\br{0,1}}{\R}$.

1. Show that

    $$
    \iint g\p{x, y} \,\diff\mu_n\p{x} \,\diff\mu_n\p{y}
    $$

    converges for every continuous $\func{g}{\br{0,1}^2}{\R}$.

2. Show by example that under the above hypotheses, it is possible that

    $$
    \iint_{\set{0 \leq x \leq y \leq 1}} \,\diff\mu_n\p{x} \,\diff\mu_n\p{y}
    $$

    does not converge.

1. By Stone-Weierstrass, the set

    $$
    A = \set{\sum_{k=1}^n f_k\p{x}g_k\p{y} \st n \in \N,\ f_k, g_k \in C\p{\br{0,1}}}
    $$

    is dense in $C\p{\br{0,1}^2}$. Hence, by applying weak convergence and Fubini's theorem, we see that $\mu_n \otimes \mu_n$ converges weakly-\* to $\mu \otimes \mu$.

2. Let $\mu_n = \delta_0$ if $n$ is odd and $\mu_n = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \delta_{k/n^2}$ for $n$ even. Then for $n$ even and $g$ is continuous,

    $$
    \int g\p{x} \,\diff\mu_n\p{x}
        = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n g\p{\frac{k}{n^2}}
        \xrightarrow{n\to\infty} g\p{0},
    $$

    by continuity, and it's clear that the same holds for the odd terms. However, for $n$ od, we have

    $$
    \int_{\set{0 \leq x \leq y \leq 1}} \diff\mu_n\p{x} \,\diff\mu_n\p{y}
        = 0
    $$

    and for $n$ even,

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        \int_{\set{0 \leq x \leq y \leq 1}} \diff\mu_n\p{x} \,\diff\mu_n\p{y}
            &= \int_0^1 \int_0^y \diff\mu_n\p{x} \,\diff\mu_n\p{y} \\
            &= \sum_{j=1}^{n^2} \int_{\pco{\frac{j-1}{n^2}, \frac{j}{n^2}}} \int_0^y \diff\mu_n\p{x} \,\diff\mu_n\p{y} \\
            &= \sum_{j=1}^n \int_{\pco{\frac{j-1}{n^2}, \frac{j}{n^2}}} \frac{j}{n} \,\diff\mu_n\p{y} + \sum_{j=n+1}^{n^2} \int_{\pco{\frac{j-1}{n^2}, \frac{j}{n^2}}} \frac{n}{n} \,\diff\mu_n\p{y} \\
            &= \sum_{j=1}^n \frac{j}{n^2} \\
            &= \frac{n + 1}{2n}
                \xrightarrow{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{2},
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    so the sequence diverges.
