<problem>

The Poisson kernel for $0 \leq \rho < 1$ is the $2\pi$ periodic function on $\R$ defined by

$$
P_\rho\p{\theta} = \Re\p{\frac{1 + \rho e^{i\theta}}{1 - \rho e^{i\theta}}}.
$$

For functions $h$ continuous on and harmonic inside the closed disc of radius $R$ about the origin, one has (you need not prove this)

$$
h\p{re^{i\eta}} = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} P_{r/R}\p{\eta - \theta} h\p{Re^{i\theta}} \,\diff\theta.
$$

Assume $h$ is harmonic and positive on the open unit disc $D = \set{z \in \C \mid \abs{z} < 1}$. Prove that there exists a poistive Borel measure $\mu$ on $\br{0, 2\pi}$ such that for all $re^{i\theta} \in D$ one has

$$
h\p{re^{i\eta}} = \int_0^{2\pi} P_r\p{\eta - \theta} \,\diff\mu\p{\theta}.
$$

<solution>

For each $0 < R < 1$, we have the measure

$$
\diff\mu_R = \frac{h\p{Re^{i\theta}}}{2\pi} \,\diff\theta.
$$

If $0 \leq r < 1$, then $Rr < R < 1$, so $h\p{Rz}$ is harmonic on $D$ and continuous on $\partial{D}$. Thus, by the Poisson kernel representation formula, we have for any $\eta \in \br{0, 2\pi}$ that

$$
h\p{Rre^{i\eta}} = \int_0^{2\pi} P_r\p{\eta - \theta} \,\diff\mu_R\p{\theta}.
$$

By Riesz representation, we may view $\set{\mu_R}_R \subseteq C\p{\br{0, 2\pi}}^\ast$. Moreover,

$$
\norm{\mu_R} = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} h\p{Re^{i\theta}} \,\diff\theta = h\p{0},
$$

by the mean value property for harmonic functions. Thus, by Banach-Alaoglu, $\set{\mu_R}_R$ admits a weak-\* convergent sequence $\set{\mu_{R_n}}_n$, where $R_n \nearrow 1$, i.e., there exists a finite, positive Borel measure $\mu \in C\p{\br{0, 2\pi}}^\ast$ such that

$$
\int_0^{2\pi} f\p{\theta} \,\diff\mu_{R_n}\p{\theta} \xrightarrow{n\to\infty} \int_0^{2\pi} f\p{\theta} \,\diff\mu\p{\theta}
$$

for any $f \in C\p{\br{0, 2\pi}}$. In particular, setting $f\p{\theta} = P_r\p{\eta - \theta}$, we have for all $n \geq 1$

$$
h\p{R_nre^{i\eta}} = \int_0^{2\pi} P_r\p{\eta - \theta} \,\diff\mu_{R_n}.
$$

Taking $n \to \infty$, we get $R_n \to 1$, so $R_nre^{i\eta} \to re^{i\eta} \in D$ where $h$ is harmonic, hence continuous, so by weak-\* convergence,

$$
h\p{re^{i\eta}} = \int_0^{2\pi} P_r\p{\eta - \theta} \,\diff\mu\p{\theta}.
$$
