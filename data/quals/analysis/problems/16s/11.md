<problem>

Assume that $f\p{z}$ is holomorphic on $\abs{z} < 2$. Show that

$$
\max_{\abs{z}=1}\,\abs{f\p{z} - \frac{1}{z}} \geq 1.
$$

</problem>

<solution>

Suppose otherwise and that $\max_{\abs{z}=1} \abs{f\p{z} - \frac{1}{z}} < 1$. If $g\p{z} = zf\p{z} - 1$, then we have

$$
\max_{\abs{z}=1}\,\abs{g\p{z}}
    = \max_{\abs{z}=1}\, \abs{z}\abs{f\p{z} - \frac{1}{z}}
    = \max_{\abs{z}=1}\, \abs{f\p{z} - \frac{1}{z}}
    < 1,
$$

so by Rouché's theorem, $1$ and $1 + g$ have the same number of zeroes, i.e., $1 + g$ does not vanish in $\D$. But this means that

$$
1 + g\p{z} = zf\p{z}
$$

does not vanish in $\D$, which is impossible as this implies that $f$ is unbounded near $z = 0$. Thus, the maximum must have been larger than $1$ to begin with.
