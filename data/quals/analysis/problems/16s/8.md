Let $\C_+ = \set{z \in \C \mid \Im{z} > 0}$ and let $\func{f_n}{\C_+}{\C_+}$ be a sequence of holomorphic functions. Show that unless $\abs{f_n} \to \infty$ uniformly on compact subsets of $\C_+$, there exists a subsequence converging uniformly on compact subsets of $\C_+$.

Let $\func{\phi}{\C_+}{\D}$ be a conformal mapping, e.g., $\phi\p{z} = \frac{z - i}{z + i}$. Thus, $\abs{\phi \circ f_n} \leq 1$, so the sequence $\set{\phi \circ f_n}_n$ forms a normal family. Hence, there exists a subsequence $\set{\phi \circ f_{n_k}}_k$ which converges locally uniformly to some holomorphic $\func{g}{\C_+}{\D}$.

Let $K \subseteq \C_+$ be a compact set. Notice that because $\phi^{-1}$ is holomorphic, it is bounded on $K$, hence Lipschitz on $K$ with some constant $C_K$. Thus, if we set $f = \phi^{-1} \circ g$

$$
\abs{f_{n_k} - f}
    = \abs{\phi^{-1}\p{\phi \circ f_{n_k}} - \phi^{-1}\p{g}}
    \leq C_K \abs{\phi \circ f_{n_k} - g},
$$

so $f_{n_k}$ converges locally uniformly to $f$, which completes the proof.
