<problem>

Let $V_1$ be a finite-dimensional subspace of the Banach space $V$. Show that there exists a continuous projection $\func{P}{V}{V_1}$, i.e., a continuous linear map $\func{P}{V}{V}$ such that $P^2 = P$ and the range of $P$ is equal to $V_1$.

<solution>

Let $\set{x_1, \ldots, x_n}$ be a basis for $V_1$. Normalizing, we may assume that $\norm{x_i} = 1$ for each $i$. We have a canonical isomorphism $\func{\phi}{V_1}{\R^n}$, via

$$
\sum_{i=1}^n c_ix_i \mapsto \sum_{i=1}^n c_ie_i
$$

In $\R^n$, we have the projection map $\func{\pi_i}{\R^n}{\R}$ onto the $i$-th component, and so $\func{\alpha_i}{V_1}{\R}$ given by $\alpha_i = \pi_i \circ \phi$ is a bounded linear functional on $V_1$. By Hahn-Banach, they all admit extensions to $\alpha_i \in V^*$, so we define

$$
P\p{x}
    = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i\p{x} x_i.
$$

$P$ is linear by construction and is continuous since

$$
\norm{P\p{x} - P\p{y}}
    \leq \p{\sum_{i=1}^n \norm{\alpha_i}}\norm{x - y},
$$

and for any $x \in V_1$,

$$
P\p{x}
    = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i\p{x}x_i
    = x
$$

by construction. Thus, $P^2 = P$ and $\im{P} = V_1$, which completes the proof.
