<problem>

Let $f$ be a non-constant meromorphic function in the complex plane. Assume that if $f$ has a pole at the point $z \in \C$, then $z$ is of the form $n\pi$ with integer $n \in \Z$. Assume that for all non-real $z$ we have the estimate

$$
\abs{f\p{z}} \leq \p{1 + \abs{\Im{z}}^{-1}}e^{-\Im{z}}.
$$

Prove that for every integer $n \in \Z$, $f$ has a pole at the point $n\pi$.

<solution>

Suppose $f$ has a pole at $n\pi$ and let $\epsilon > 0$. Then for $z = n\pi + i\epsilon$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \abs{\p{z - n\pi}f\p{z}}
      &\leq \p{\abs{z - n\pi} + \frac{\abs{z - n\pi}}{\abs{\Im{z}}}}e^{-\Im{z}} \\
      &= \p{\epsilon + 1}e^{-\epsilon}.
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, $\p{z - n\pi}f\p{z}$ is bounded as $\epsilon \to 0$, so $f$ must have a simple pole at $n\pi$. Indeed, if $f$ had a pole with higher order, then $\abs{\p{z - n\pi}f\p{z}}$ must diverge to $\infty$ from any path.

Let $g\p{z} = f\p{z}\sin{z}$. Because $f$ had a simple pole at each $n\pi$ and $\sin{z}$ has a simple zero at each $n\pi$, we have by the factor theorem that $\sin{z} = \p{z - n\pi}h\p{z}$, where $h$ is holomorphic near $n\pi$. Thus, $g\p{z} = \p{z - n\pi}f\p{z}h\p{z}$, so $g$ is holomorphic at $n\pi$. In particular, $g$ is entire.

Also notice that by definition,

$$
\abs{\sin{z}}
    \leq \abs{\frac{e^{iz} - e^{-iz}}{2i}}
    \leq \frac{e^{\abs{z}} + e^{\abs{z}}}{2}
    = e^{\abs{z}},
$$

so we have the bound

$$
\abs{g\p{z}} \leq 1 + \frac{1}{\abs{\Im{z}}}.
$$

We will show that $g$ vanishes nowhere. By Jensen's formula, if $g$ has zero anywhere, then

$$
\frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \log\abs{g\p{Re^{i\theta}}} \,\diff\theta
    \geq A\log{R}
$$

for $A$ large enough, so it suffices to prove that this integral tends to $0$. By our previous estimate,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \log\abs{g\p{Re^{i\theta}}} \,\diff\theta
        &\leq \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \log\abs{1 + \frac{1}{R\abs{\sin\theta}}} \,\diff\theta \\
        &= \frac{2}{\pi} \int_0^{\pi/2} \log\abs{1 + \frac{1}{R\sin\theta}} \,\diff\theta.
\end{aligned}
$$

The equality comes from periodicity of $\sin\theta$. Write $\theta = \frac{t\pi}{2}$ for $t \in \br{0, 1}$ so that by concavity of $\sin\theta$,

$$
\sin\theta \geq t\sin\frac{\pi}{2} = t = \frac{2\theta}{\pi}.
$$

Since $t \in \br{0, 1}$ this inequality holds for $\theta \in \br{0, \frac{\pi}{2}}$ and combining this with the change of variables $u = \frac{1}{\theta}$ to get

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \log\abs{g\p{Re^{i\theta}}} \,\diff\theta
        &\leq \frac{2}{\pi} \int_0^{\pi/2} \log\abs{1 + \frac{\pi}{2R\theta}} \,\diff\theta \\
        &\leq \frac{2}{\pi} \int_{2/\pi}^\infty \frac{1}{u^2} \log\abs{1 + \frac{u\pi}{2R}} \,\diff{u}.
\end{aligned}
$$

Finally, notice that for $u$ large enough,

$$
\frac{1}{u^2} \log\abs{1 + \frac{u\pi}{2R}}
    \leq \frac{u^{1/2}}{u^2}
    = \frac{1}{u^{3/2}} \in L^1\p{\pco{\frac{2}{\pi}, \infty}}.
$$

Thus, by dominated convergence,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \lim_{R\to\infty} \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \log\abs{g\p{Re^{i\theta}}} \,\diff\theta
        &\leq \lim_{R\to\infty} \frac{2}{\pi} \int_{2/\pi}^\infty \frac{1}{u^2} \log\abs{1 + \frac{u\pi}{2R}} \,\diff{u} \\
        &= \frac{2}{\pi} \int_{2/\pi}^\infty \frac{1}{u^2} \log{1} \,\diff{u} \\
        &= 0.
\end{aligned}
$$

Hence, $g$ has no zeroes. Because $g$ is entire, it follows from Liouville's theorem applied to $\frac{1}{g}$ that $g$ is constant, i.e.,

$$
f\p{z}\sin{z} = C \implies f\p{z} = \frac{C}{\sin{z}}.
$$

As a result, $f$ has a simple pole at $n\pi$ for every $n \in \Z$, as desired.
