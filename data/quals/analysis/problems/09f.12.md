<problem>

Let $f$ be a non-constant meromorphic function in the complex plane. Assume that if $f$ has a pole at the point $z \in \C$, then $z$ is of the form $n\pi$ with integer $n \in \Z$. Assume that for all non-real $z$ we have the estimate

$$
\abs{f\p{z}} \leq \p{1 + \abs{\Im{z}}^{-1}}e^{-\Im{z}}.
$$

Prove that for every integer $n \in \Z$, $f$ has a pole at the point $n\pi$.
