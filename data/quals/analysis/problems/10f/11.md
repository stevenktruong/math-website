Let $\Omega \subseteq \C$ be a non-empty open connected set. If $\func{f}{\Omega}{\C}$ is harmonic and $f^2$ is also harmonic, show that either $f$ or $\conj{f}$ is holomorphic on $\Omega$.

Recall the Wirtinger derivatives:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \pder{f}{z}
        &= \frac{1}{2}\p{\pder{f}{x} - i\pder{f}{y}} \\
    \pder{f}{\conj{z}}
        &= \frac{1}{2}\p{\pder{f}{x} + i\pder{f}{y}}.
\end{aligned}
$$

From a quick calculation,

$$
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial z \partial \conj{z}}
    = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial \conj{z} \partial z}
    = \frac{\Delta{f}}{4}.
$$

where $\Delta$ is the Laplacian. By assumption on $f$, we have

$$
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial \conj{z} \partial z} = 0
\quad\text{and}\quad
\frac{\partial^2 f^2}{\partial \conj{z} \partial z} = 0
$$

Since the Wirtinger derivatives are derivations, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
\pder{f^2}{z} = 2f \pder{f}{z}
\implies
\frac{\partial^2 f^2}{\partial \conj{z} \partial z}
    &= 2\pder{f}{\conj{z}} \pder{f}{z} + 2f \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial \conj{z} \partial z} \\
    &= 2\pder{f}{\conj{z}} \pder{f}{z}.
\end{aligned}
$$

Since the left-hand side vanishes, we are left with

$$
\pder{f}{\conj{z}} \pder{f}{z} = 0.
$$

Now suppose $f$ is not holomorphic. In particular, $f$ is harmonic hence $C^1$, which implies that $f$ does not satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations everywhere on $\Omega$. Thus, there exists $z_0 \in \Omega$ such that $\pder{f}{\conj{z}}\p{z_0} \neq 0$. By continuity, this means that $\pder{f}{\conj{z}} \neq 0$ on a neighborhood of $z_0$. By the equation above, this implies that $\pder{f}{z}$ vanishes on a non-empty open set. Since $\Omega$ is connected and $\pder{f}{z}$ is harmonic, $\pder{f}{z}$ is identically $0$. Hence,

$$
0
    = \conj{\pder{f}{z}}
    = \frac{1}{2} \p{\conj{\pder{f}{x}} + i\conj{\pder{f}{y}}}
    = \frac{1}{2} \p{\pder{\conj{f}}{x} + i\pder{\conj{f}}{y}}
    = \pder{\conj{f}}{\conj{z}},
$$

so $\conj{f}$ satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations, hence holomorphic.
