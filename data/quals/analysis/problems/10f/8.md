Let $A\p{\D}$ be the $\C$-vector space of all holomorphic functions on $\D$ and suppose that $\func{L}{A\p{\D}}{\C}$ is a multiplicative linear functional, that is,

$$
L\p{af + bg} = aL\p{f} + bL\p{g}
\quad\text{and}\quad
L\p{fg} = L\p{f}L\p{g}
$$

for all $a, b \in \C$ and all $f, g \in A\p{\D}$. If $L$ is not identically zero, show that there is $z_0 \in \D$ so that $L\p{f} = f\p{z_0}$ for all $f \in A\p{\D}$.

Set $z_0 = L\p{z}$. Since $L$ is not identically zero, there exists $f \in A\p{\D}$ such that $L\p{f} \neq 0$. Thus, by multiplicity of $L$, we have $L\p{f \cdot 1} = L\p{f}L\p{1} \implies L\p{1} = 1$. Similarly, $L\p{z^n} = \p{L\p{z}}^n = z_0^n$, and so by linearity of $L$, we have shown that the claim is true whenever $f$ is a polynomial.

Now let $f \in A\p{\D}$. Since $f$ is holomorphic, we may apply the factor theorem to get $f\p{z} - f\p{z_0} = \p{z - z_0}g\p{z}$. By multiplicity of $L$, $L\p{f\p{z} - f\p{z_0}} = L\p{z - z_0}L\p{g\p{z}} = 0$. By linearity, we conclude that

$$
L\p{f\p{z}}
    = L\p{f\p{z_0}}
    = f\p{z_0}L\p{1}
    = f\p{z_0}.
$$

To complete the proof, we need to show that $z_0 \in \D$. If this were not the case, then $f\p{z} = \frac{1}{z - z_0} \in A\p{\D}$, which implies that $L\p{f\p{z}} = f\p{z_0} = \infty \in \C$, but this is absurd.
