<problem>

Let $\mathcal{F}$ be the family of functions $f$ holomorphic on $\D$ with

$$
\iint_{\set{x^2 + y^2 < 1}} \abs{f\p{x + iy}}^2 \,\diff{x} \,\diff{y} < 1.
$$

Prove that for each compact subset $K \subseteq \D$ there is a constant $A$ so that $\abs{f\p{z}} < A$ for all $z \in K$ and all $f \in \mathcal{F}$.

<solution>

First, let $B\p{z_0, R}$ be an open ball with closure contained in $\D$. Let $f \in \mathcal{F}$, so that we can apply the mean value property:

$$
f\p{z_0}
    = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} f\p{z_0 + Re^{i\theta}} \,\diff\theta.
$$

Multiplying by $2r$, integrating from $0$ to $R$, and applying a change-of-coordinates, we end up with the two-dimensional mean value property:

$$
f\p{z_0} = \frac{1}{\pi R^2} \int_{B\p{z_0,R}} f\p{x + iy} \,\diff{A}.
$$

By the triangle inequality, HÃ¶lder's inequality, and assumption on $\mathcal{F}$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \abs{f\p{z_0}}
        &\leq \frac{1}{\pi R^2} \int_{B\p{z_0,R}} \abs{f\p{x + iy}} \,\diff{A} \\
        &\leq \frac{1}{\pi R^2} \p{\int_{B\p{z_0,R}} \abs{f\p{x + iy}}^2 \,\diff{A}}^{1/2} \p{\int_{B\p{z_0,R}} \diff{A}}^{1/2} \\
        &\leq \frac{m\p{B\p{z_0, R}}^{1/2}}{\pi R^2} \\
        &\leq \frac{m\p{\D}^{1/2}}{\pi R^2}.
\end{aligned}
$$

where $m$ denotes the Lebesgue measure. Now let $K \subseteq \D$ be any compact set, and let $\delta = \frac{1}{2}d\p{K, \D^\comp}$, which is positive since it's a distance between two disjoint closed sets. For any $z \in K$, $B\p{z, \delta} \subseteq \D$, so by our previous calculation,

$$
\abs{f\p{z}}
    \leq \frac{m\p{\D}^{1/2}}{\pi\delta^2}
$$

for all $z \in \D$. This bound is independent of choice of $f$, so this bound holds for all $f \in \mathcal{F}$ as well, which completes the proof.
