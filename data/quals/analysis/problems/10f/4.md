<problem>

Let $T$ be a linear transformation on $C_\mathrm{c}^0\p{\R}$, the space of continuous functions of compact support, that has the following two properties:

$$
\norm{Tf}_{L^\infty} \leq \norm{f}_{L^\infty}
\quad\text{and}\quad
\abs{\set{x \in \R \mid \abs{Tf\p{x}} > \lambda}} \leq \frac{\norm{f}_{L^1}}{\lambda}.
$$

(Here $\abs{A}$ denotes the Lebesgue measure of the set $A$.) Prove that

$$
\int \abs{Tf\p{x}}^2 \,\diff{x}
    \leq C \int \abs{f\p{x}}^2 \,\diff{x}
$$

for all $f \in C_\mathrm{c}^0\p{\R}$ and some fixed number $C$.

<solution>

First, we have the following identity:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \int_\R \abs{Tf\p{x}}^2 \,\diff{x}
        &= \int_\R \int_0^{\abs{Tf\p{x}}} 2\lambda \,\diff\lambda \,\diff{x} \\
        &= \int_\R \int_0^\infty 2\lambda \chi_{\set{0 < \lambda < \abs{Tf\p{x}}}} \,\diff\lambda \,\diff{x} \\
        &= \int_0^\infty 2\lambda \int_\R \chi_{\set{0 < \lambda < \abs{Tf\p{x}}}} \,\diff{x} \,\diff\lambda \\
        &= \int_0^\infty 2\lambda m\p{\set{\abs{Tf\p{x}} > \lambda}} \,\diff\lambda.
\end{aligned}
$$

In the above, we switched the order of integration by applying Fubini-Tonelli, which we can do since everything is non-negative.
