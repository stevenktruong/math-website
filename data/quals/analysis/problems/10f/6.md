Let $\cl{\D} = \set{z \in \C \mid \abs{z} \leq 1}$ and consider the (complex) Hilbert space

$$
\mathcal{H} = \set{\func{f}{\cl{\D}}{\C} \st f\p{z} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \hat{f}\p{k}z^k \text{ with } \norm{f}^2 = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \p{1 + k^2}\abs{\hat{f}\p{k}}^2 < \infty}.
$$

1. Prove that the linear function $L\colon f \mapsto f\p{1}$ is bounded.
2. Find the element $g \in \mathcal{H}$ representing $L$.
3. Show that $f \mapsto \Re{L\p{f}}$ achieves its maximal value on the set

    $$
    \mathcal{B} = \set{f \in \mathcal{H} \st \norm{f} \leq 1 \text{ and } f\p{0} = 0},
    $$

    that this maximum occurs at a unique point, and determine this maximal value.

1. By Cauchy-Schwarz,

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        \abs{f\p{1}}
            &\leq \sum_{k=0}^\infty \abs{\hat{f}\p{k}}\sqrt{1 + k^2} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + k^2}} \\
            &\leq \p{\sum_{k=0}^\infty \p{1 + k^2}\abs{\hat{f}\p{k}}^2}^{1/2} \p{\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{1 + k^2}}^{1/2} \\
            &= \p{\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{1 + k^2}}^{1/2} \norm{f},
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    and because the series converges, $L$ is bounded.

2. We assume that the inner product is given by

    $$
    \inner{f, g} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \hat{f}\p{k}\conj{\hat{g}\p{k}} \p{1 + k^2}.
    $$

    If $g$ represents $L$, then it must satisfy

    $$
    \inner{f, g} = f\p{1}
    \iff \sum_{k=0}^\infty \hat{f}\p{k}\conj{\hat{g}\p{k}} \p{1 + k^2} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \hat{f}\p{k}
    $$

    for any $f \in \mathcal{H}$. Thus, if we set

    $$
    g\p{z} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{z^k}{1 + k^2},
    $$

    then the identity is satisfied. This definition makes sense as the series converges on $\cl{\D}$, so it remains to show that $g \in \mathcal{H}$ by showing that $\norm{g} < \infty$. But this is clear:

    $$
    \norm{g}^2
        = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{1 + k^2}
        < \infty,
    $$

    so $g \in \mathcal{H}$ and we are done.

3. Observe that if $0 < \norm{f} < 1$, then

    $$
    \Re{L\p{f}}
        < \frac{\Re{L\p{f}}}{\norm{f}}
        = \Re{L\p{\frac{f}{\norm{f}}}}.
    $$

    Thus, if the maximum is attained, it must occur with $\norm{f} = 1$. Also, notice that for $z \in \C$, $\Re{z} \leq \abs{z}$, and the maximum is attained if and only if $z$ is real. Thus, if there exists $k \geq 0$ such that $\hat{f}\p{k}$ is not real, then

    $$
    \Re{f\p{1}}
        = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \Re\hat{f}\p{k}
        < \sum_{k=0}^\infty \abs{\hat{f}\p{k}}.
    $$

    Thus, if we replace $\hat{f}\p{k}$ with $\abs{\hat{f}\p{k}}$, then the resulting function is still in $\mathcal{H}$ and gives a strictly larger value. Thus, the maximum must be attained by a function $f$ with $\hat{f}\p{k}$ real. Similarly, if we remove negative values of $\hat{f}\p{k}$, we get a strictly larger value, so the maximum also has non-negative coefficients. Hence, from now, we only need to consider $f$ with $\hat{f}\p{k} \geq 0$ for all $k \geq 0$ and $\norm{f} = 1$.

    Observe that with this restriction, $\Re{L\p{f}} = f\p{1}$. By the same argument as in (2), we also see that on $\mathcal{B}$, this functional is represented by

    $$
    g\p{z} = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{z^k}{1 + k^2},
    $$

    i.e., the same $g$ as in (2), but with the constant term removed. Thus, by Cauchy-Schwarz,

    $$
    \Re{f\p{1}}
         = f\p{1}
         = \inner{f, g}
         \leq \norm{f}\norm{g}
         = \norm{g},
    $$

    since $\norm{f} = 1$. From here, we see that the maximum is attained uniquely by $f = \frac{g}{\norm{g}}$, so it remains to show that this choice of $f$ is in $\mathcal{B}$.

    It's clear that $\norm{f} = 1$, and

    $$
    f\p{0}
        = \frac{g\p{0}}{\norm{g}}
        = 0
    $$

    by construction, so $f \in \mathcal{H}$. Finally, the maximal value is given by

    $$
    \frac{g\p{1}}{\norm{g}}
        = \p{\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{1 + k^2}}\p{\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{1 + k^2}}^{-1/2}
        = \p{\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{1 + k^2}}^{1/2},
    $$

    which completes the proof.
