Let $\p{X, \rho}$ be a compact metric space and let $P\p{X}$ be the set of all probability measures on the Borel sigma-algebra of $X$ (i.e., $\mu \in P\p{X}$ if $\mu$ is a positive Borel measure and $\mu\p{X} = 1$). Assume $\set{\mu_n}_n$ is a sequence in $P\p{X}$ and $\mu$ is another element of $P\p{X}$ such that for all continuous $\func{f}{X}{\R}$,

$$
\int_X f\p{x} \,\diff\mu_n
    \xrightarrow{n\to\infty} \int_X f\p{x} \,\diff\mu.
$$

Prove that

$$
\mu_n\p{E}
    \xrightarrow{n\to\infty} \mu\p{E}
$$

whenever $E$ is a Borel subset of $X$ such that $\mu\p{\cl{E}} = \mu\p{E^\itr}$, where $\cl{E}$ is the closure of $E$ and $E^\itr$ is the interior of $E$.

<solution>

Observe that $\chi_{E^\itr} \leq \chi_E \leq \chi_{\cl{E}}$. Since $\cl{E}$ is closed, $\chi_{\cl{E}}$ is upper-semicontinuous and because $E^\itr$ is open, $\chi_{E^\itr}$ is lower-semicontinuous. Hence, because $X$ is a metric space, we get sequences of continuous functions $\set{f_n}_n$ and $\set{g_n}_n$ such that $f_n$ decreases to $\chi_{\cl{E}}$ and $g_n$ increases to $\chi_{E^\itr}$. Thus,

$$
\begin{gathered}
    \int_X g_k \,\diff\mu_n
        \leq \mu_n\p{E^\itr}
        \leq \mu_n\p{E}
        \leq \mu_n\p{\cl{E}}
        \leq \int_X f_k \,\diff\mu_n \\
    \implies
    \int_X g_k \,\diff\mu
        \leq \liminf_{n\to\infty} \mu_n\p{E}
        \leq \limsup_{n\to\infty} \mu_n\p{E}
        \leq \int_X f_k \,\diff\mu
\end{gathered}
$$

by weak-\* convergence.

By continuity, $g_1$ is bounded from below by $M > 0$, so $g_k + M \geq 0$. By monotone convergence,

$$
\lim_{k\to\infty} \int_X g_k \,\diff\mu
    = \lim_{k\to\infty} \int_X \p{g_k + M} - M \,\diff\mu
    = \int_X \chi_{E^\itr} + M \,\diff\mu - \int_X M \,\diff\mu
    = \int_X \chi_{E^\itr} \,\diff\mu,
$$

since $\mu$ is a probability is a probability measure, i.e., constants are integrable. Similarly, $f_1$ is bounded, hence $\mu$-integrable, so by dominated convergence,

$$
\lim_{k\to\infty} \int_X f_k \,\diff\mu
    = \int_X \chi_{\cl{E}} \,\diff\mu.
$$

Altogether, we get

$$
\mu\p{E^\itr}
    \leq \liminf_{n\to\infty} \mu_n\p{E}
    \leq \limsup_{n\to\infty} \mu_n\p{E}
    \leq \mu\p{\cl{E}}
    = \mu\p{E^\itr},
$$

so these are equalities, and so

$$
\lim_{n\to\infty} \mu_n \p{E}
    = \mu\p{E},
$$

as desired.
