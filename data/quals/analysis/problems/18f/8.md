Let $\mathcal{D}$ be the space of analytic functions $f\p{z}$ on the unit disc $\D = \set{z \mid \abs{z} < 1}$ such that $f\p{0} = 0$ and $\int_\D \abs{f'\p{z}}^2 \,\diff{x} \,\diff{y} < \infty$.

1. Prove that $\mathcal{D}$ is complete in the norm

    $$
    \norm{f}
        = \p{\int_\D \abs{f'\p{z}} \,\diff{x} \,\diff{y}}^{1/2}.
    $$

2. Give a necessary and sufficient condition on the coefficients $a_n$ for the function $f\p{z} = \sum_{n\geq1} a_n z^n$ to belong to $\mathcal{D}$.

1. Let $\set{f_n}_n$ be Cauchy in $\mathcal{D}$. Notice by the mean value property, $\set{f_n'}_n$ is uniformly bounded on compact sets, i.e., $\set{f_n'}_n$ is a normal family. Hence, $f_n' \to g$ locally uniformly in $\D$ for some holomorphic $g$ on $\D$.

    Let $f\p{z} = \int_0^z g\p{w} \,\diff{w}$, where integration is done on the segment $\br{0, z}$. Then $f\p{0} = 0$ by construction and

    $$
    \abs{f_n\p{z} - f\p{z}}
        \leq \int_0^z \abs{f_n'\p{w} - f\p{w}} \,\diff{w},
    $$

    so $f_n \to f$ locally uniformly as well. Thus, we see that $f_n\p{0} \to f\p{0}$ and $f_n'$ converges locally uniformly to $g$, so $f_n$ converges locally uniformly to $f$ with $f' = g$. By Fatou's lemma, we also see that $\norm{f} \leq \sup_n \norm{f_n} < \infty$, since $\set{f_n}_n$ is Cauchy, so $\mathcal{D}$ is complete.

2. First, suppose that $f$ is holomorphic in $\D$ with $f\p{0} = 0$. We may then write $f\p{z} = \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n z^n$. Then because its Taylor series converges locally uniformly,

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        \norm{f}^2
            &= \int_\D \abs{f'\p{z}}^2 \,\diff{x} \,\diff{y} \\
            &= \int_\D \p{\sum_{n=1}^\infty na_n z^{n-1}} \conj{\p{\sum_{m=1}^\infty ma_m z^{m-1}}} \,\diff{x} \,\diff{y} \\
            &= \int_0^1 r \int_0^{2\pi} \p{\sum_{n=1}^\infty na_n r^{n-1} e^{i\p{n-1}\theta}} \conj{\p{\sum_{m=1}^\infty ma_m r^{m-1} e^{i\p{m-1}\theta}}} \,\diff{\theta} \,\diff{r} \\
            &= \sum_{n=0}^\infty 2\pi \int_0^1 n^2\abs{a_n}^2 r^{2n-1} \,\diff{r} \\
            &= 2\pi \sum_{n=0}^\infty n\abs{a_n}^2.
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    Thus, $f \in \mathcal{D}$ if and only if $a_0 = 0$ and $\sum_{n=0}^\infty n\abs{a_n}^2 < \infty$.
