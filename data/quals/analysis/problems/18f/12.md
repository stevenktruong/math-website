If $\alpha \in \C$ satisfies $0 < \abs{\alpha} < 1$ and if $n \in \N = \set{1, 2, 3, \ldots}$ show that the equation

$$
e^z\p{z - 1}^n = \alpha
$$

has exactly $n$ simple roots int he half-plane $\set{z \mid \Re{z} > 0}$.

<solution>

Consider the homotopy $f_t\p{z} = e^{tz} \p{z - 1}^n$. Observe that on the circle $\abs{z - 1} = 1$, we have

$$
\abs{f_t\p{z}}
    = e^{t\Re{z}}
    \geq e^0
    = 1
    > \abs{\alpha},
$$

so $f_t\p{z} - \alpha$ never vanishes on this circle. Thus, by Cauchy's theorem, if $\gamma$ is the curve $\abs{z - 1} = 1$, we get

$$
\frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_\gamma \frac{f_t'\p{z}}{f_t\p{z} - \alpha}
    = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{f_t\p{\gamma}} \frac{\diff{w}}{w - \alpha}
$$

is a constant. When $t = 0$, we get $f_0\p{z} = \p{z - 1}^n$, so the integral is equal to $n$, and by the argument principle, this means that $e^z\p{z - 1}^n = \alpha$ has precisely $n$ solutions in the interior of the circle $\abs{z - 1} = 1$.

To show that these solutions are simple, suppose $w$ is a solution to the equation. Then if $f\p{z} = e^z\p{z - 1}^n$, then

$$
f'\p{z}
    = e^z\p{z - 1}^n + ne^z\p{z - 1}^{n-1}
\implies
f'\p{w}
    = \alpha + \frac{n\alpha}{w - 1}.
$$

This is $0$ if and only if

$$
1 + \frac{n}{w - 1} = 0
\implies w = 1 - n,
$$

but $\Re\p{1 - n} \leq 0$, but $\Re{w} > 0$. Thus, any solution to the equation must be simple.
