<problem>

Some of the following statements about sequences of functions $f_n$ in $L^3\p{\br{0, 1}}$. Indicate these and provide an appropriate counterexample.

1. If $f_n$ converges to $f$ almost everywhere then a subsequence converges to $f$ in $L^3$.
2. If $f_n$ converges to $f$ in $L^3$ then a subsequence converges almost everywhere.
3. If $f_n$ converges to $f$ in measure then the sequence converges to $f$ in $L^3$.
4. If $f_n$ converges to $f$ in $L^3$ then the sequence converges to $f$ in measure.

<solution>

1. False. Consider $f_n = n^{1/3}\chi_{\br{0,\frac{1}{n}}}$, which converges to $f = 0$ everywhere except at $x = 0$. But

    $$
    \norm{f_n - f}_{L^3}^3
        = \int_0^{1/n} n \,\diff{x}
        = 1,
    $$

    so no subsequence can possibly converge to $f$ in $L^3$.

2. True.

3. False. The same example as in (1) works: for any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists $N$ so that $N^{1/3} \geq \epsilon$. Thus, for $n \geq N$, $\abs{f_n - f} = n^{1/3} \geq N^{1/3} \geq \epsilon$ on $\br{0, \frac{1}{n}}$ and $0$ otherwise, so

    $$
    m\p{\set{\abs{f_n - f} \geq \epsilon}}
        = m\p{\br{0, \frac{1}{n}}}
        = \frac{1}{n} \xrightarrow{n\to\infty} 0.
    $$

    But as we saw, $f_n$ does not converge to $f$ in $L^3$.

4. True.
