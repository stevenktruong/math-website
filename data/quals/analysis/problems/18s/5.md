Let $\mu$ be a real-valued Borel measure on $\br{0, 1}$ such that

$$
\int_0^1 \frac{1}{x + t} \,\diff\mu\p{t} = 0
\quad\text{for all } x > 1.
$$

Show that $\mu = 0$.

By Riesz representation, we see $\mu \in \p{C\p{\br{0,1}}}^*$, so it suffices to show that $\int_0^1 f\p{t} \,\diff\mu\p{t} = 0$ for all $f \in C\p{\br{0,1}}$.

First, observe that by the mean value theorem, if $\abs{h} < x - 1$, then there exists $\xi \in \br{1, x}$ so that

$$
\abs{\frac{1}{h}\p{\frac{1}{\p{\p{x + h} + t}^n} - \frac{1}{\p{x + t}^n}}}
    = \abs{\frac{n}{\p{\xi + t}^{n+1}}}
    \leq n.
$$

Since $\mu\p{\br{0,1}} \in \R$, in particular $\mu$ is finite, and so constants are in $L^1\p{\mu}$. By dominated convergence,

$$
0
    = \lim_{h\to0} \frac{1}{h} \int_0^1 \frac{1}{\p{\p{x + h} + t}^n} - \frac{1}{\p{x + t}^n} \,\diff\mu\p{t}
    = -n \int_0^1 \frac{1}{\p{x + t}^{n+1}} \,\diff\mu\p{t}.
$$

Indeed, this is true for $n = 1$ by assumption, and it follows for all $n \in \N$ by induction. Hence, we have shown that

$$
\int_0^1 \frac{1}{\p{x + t}^n} \,\diff\mu\p{t} = 0
$$

for all $n \geq 1$. Now let $A$ be the set of all finite $\R$-linear combinations of $\frac{1}{\p{2 + t}^n}$ for $n \geq 1$. It's clear that $A$ is a subalgebra of $C\p{\br{0,1}}$, that it vanishes nowhere, and that it separates points (e.g., $\frac{1}{2 + t}$ does both). By Stone-Weierstrass, we see that $A$ is dense in $C\p{\br{0,1}}$. Since $\mu$ is $0$ on a dense subset of $C\p{\br{0,1}}$, it follows that $\mu$ is $0$ on all of $C\p{\br{0,1}}$, and so $\mu = 0$, which was what we wanted to show.
