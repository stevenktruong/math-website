Find a function $u\p{x, y}$ harmonic in the region between the circles $\abs{z} = 2$ and $\abs{z - 1} = 1$ which equals $1$ on the outer circle and $0$ on the inner circle (except at the point where the circles are tangent to each other).

Our strategy will be to apply a conformal mapping to simplify our domain, and then undo the change of variables.

The main issue is that circles are hard to work with, so we wish to apply a Möbius transformation transform them into lines. Hence, a Möbius transform which sends $2 \mapsto \infty$ suffices, and $\phi\p{z} = \frac{1}{z - 2}$ works.

$\phi$ sends the circle $\abs{z} = 2$ to the line containing

$$
\phi\p{-2} = -\frac{1}{4}
\quad\text{and}\quad
\phi\p{2i} = -\frac{1}{4} - \frac{i}{4},
$$

i.e., the line $\Re{z} = -\frac{1}{4}$, and it sends the circle $\abs{z - 1} = 1$ to the line containing

$$
\phi\p{0} = -\frac{1}{2}
\quad\text{and}\quad
\phi\p{1 + i} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{i}{2},
$$

the line $\Re{z} = -\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, we need a harmonic function which is $0$ when $\Re{z} = -\frac{1}{2}$ and $1$ when $\Re{z} = -\frac{1}{4}$. For example, $v\p{x, y} = 4\p{x + \frac{1}{2}} = 4x + 2$ works, which gives

$$
u\p{x, y}
    = v\p{\phi\p{x + iy}}
    = 4\Re\p{\frac{1}{z - 2}} + 2.
$$
