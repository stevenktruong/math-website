Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a separable infinite-dimensional Hilbert space and assume that $\set{e_n}$ is an orthonormal system in $\mathcal{H}$. Let $\set{f_n}_n$ be another orthonormal system which is complete, i.e., the closure of the span of the $\set{f_n}_n$ is all of $\mathcal{H}$.

1. Show that if $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \norm{f_n - e_n}^2 < 1$, then the orthonormal system $\set{e_n}_n$ is also complete.
2. Assume that we only have $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \norm{f_n - e_n}^2 < \infty$. Prove that it is still true that $\set{e_n}_n$ is complete.

1. Let $x \in \mathcal{H}$ be such that $\inner{x, e_n} = 0$ for all $n \geq 1$. Since $\set{f_n}_n$ is complete, we can write $x = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \inner{x, f_n}f_n$. To make use of the condition given, set $y = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \inner{x, f_n}e_n$, which gives

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        \norm{x - y}^2
            &= \norm{\sum_{n=1}^\infty \inner{x, e_n}\p{e_n - f_n}}^2 \\
            &\leq \p{\sum_{n=1}^\infty \abs{\inner{x, f_n}}\norm{e_n - f_n}}^2 \\
            &\leq \p{\sum_{n=1}^\infty \abs{\inner{x, f_n}}^2} \p{\sum_{n=1}^\infty \norm{e_n - f_n}^2}
                && \p{\text{Cauchy-Schwarz}} \\
            &\leq \norm{x}^2.
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    But by assumption, $\inner{x, e_n} = 0$ for all $n \geq 1$, which implies that $\inner{x, y} = 0$. Hence, by the Pythagorean theorem,

    $$
    \norm{x}^2 + \norm{y}^2 \leq \norm{x}^2
    \implies y = 0,
    $$

    and so $\inner{x, f_n} = 0$ for all $n \geq 1$ as well. Since $\set{f_n}_n$ was complete, this implies that $x = 0$, so $\set{x_n}_n$ is complete as well.

2. For $N \in \N$, let $E_N = \cl{\span{\set{e_N, e_{N+1}, \ldots}}}$ and $F_N = \cl{\span{\set{f_N, f_{N+1}, \ldots}}}$. Since these are closed subspaces, we have orthogonal projections $\pi_{E_N}$ and $\pi_{V_N}$, respectively. Then for any $x \in \mathcal{H}$,

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        \norm{\pi_{E_N}\p{x} - \pi_{V_N}\p{x}}
            &= \norm{\sum_{n=N}^\infty \inner{x, e_n}e_n - \sum_{n=N}^\infty \inner{x, f_n}f_n} \\
            &\leq \norm{\sum_{n=N}^\infty \inner{x, e_n}\p{e_n - f_n}} + \norm{\sum_{n=N}^\infty \inner{x, e_n - f_n}f_n} \\
            &\leq \sum_{n=N}^\infty \abs{\inner{x, e_n}} \norm{e_n - f_n} + \p{\sum_{n=N}^\infty \abs{\inner{x, e_n - f_n}}^2}^{1/2} \\
            &\leq \p{\sum_{n=N}^\infty \abs{\inner{x, e_n}}^2}^{1/2} \p{\sum_{n=N}^\infty \norm{e_n - f_n}^2}^{1/2} + \p{\sum_{n=N}^\infty \norm{x}^2 \norm{e_n - f_n}^2}^{1/2}
                && \p{\text{Cauchy-Schwarz}} \\
            &\leq 2\norm{x} \p{\sum_{n=N}^\infty \norm{e_n - f_n}^2}^{1/2}.
                && \p{\text{Bessel's inequality}}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    We will show that for large values of $N$, $E_N$ and $F_N$ intuitively capture the same amount of information. More precisely, we will show that because $F_N^\perp$ is finite dimensional ($\set{f_n}_n$ is a complete orthonormal system), this forces $E_N^\perp$ to be finite dimensional as well.

    Hence, $\norm{\pi_{E_N} - \pi_{F_N}} \to 0$ as $N \to \infty$. Notice also that $\mathcal{H} = E_N \oplus E_N^\perp = F_N \oplus F_N^\perp$, which means $\pi_{E_N^\perp} = \id - \pi_{E_N}$ and $\pi_{F_N^\perp} = \id - \pi_{F_N}$. Thus,

    $$
    \norm{\pi_{E_N^\perp} - \pi_{F_N^\perp}}
        = \norm{\p{\id - \pi_{E_N}} - \p{\id - \pi_{F_N}}}
        = \norm{\pi_{E_N} - \pi_{F_N}}.
    $$

    Let $N$ be large enough so that $\norm{\pi_{E_N^\perp} - \pi_{F_N^\perp}} < \frac{1}{2}$. Since $F_N^\perp$ has dimension $N - 1$, any set $\set{x_1, \ldots, x_n}$ of $N$ elements must be linearly dependent after projecting to $F_N^\perp$. In particular, if $x_1, \ldots, x_n \in E_N^\perp$, then there exist $c_1, \ldots, c_n$ such that

    $$
    0
        = \sum_{n=1}^N c_n\pi_{F_N}\p{x_n}
        = \pi_{F_N}\p{\sum_{n=1}^N c_nx_n}.
    $$

    Then by the triangle inequality,

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        \norm{\sum_{n=1}^N c_nx_n}
            &= \norm{\pi_{E_N}\p{\sum_{n=1}^N c_nx_n}} \\
            &\leq \norm{\p{\pi_{E_N} - \pi_{F_N}}\p{\sum_{n=1}^N c_nx_n}} + \norm{\pi_{F_N}\p{\sum_{n=1}^N c_nx_n}} \\
            &\leq \norm{\pi_{E_N} - \pi_{F_N}} \norm{\sum_{n=1}^N c_nx_n} \\
            &\leq \frac{1}{2}\norm{\sum_{n=1}^N c_nx_n},
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    which implies that $\sum_{n=1}^N c_nx_n = 0$, i.e., $\set{x_1, \ldots, x_n}$ is linearly dependent in $E_N^\perp$. Since these vectors were arbitrary, it follows that $\dim{E_N^\perp} \leq N - 1$. But $E_N^\perp$ contain the orthonormal set $\set{e_1, \ldots, e_{N-1}}$, so $\dim{E_N^\perp} = N - 1$, i.e., $\set{e_1, \ldots, e_{N-1}}$ spans $E_N^\perp$, and so $\set{e_n}_n$ is a complete orthonormal system.
