<problem>

Assume that $f\p{z}$ is analytic in $\set{z \mid \abs{z} < 1}$ and continuous on $\set{z \mid \abs{z} \leq 1}$. If $f\p{z} = f\p{1/z}$ when $\abs{z} = 1$, prove that $f\p{z}$ is constant.

<solution>

Define

$$
g\p{z}
    =   \begin{cases}
            f\p{z} & \text{if } \abs{z} \leq 1 \\
            f\p{1/z} & \text{if } \abs{z} \geq 1,
        \end{cases}
$$

which is well-defined by assumption. $g$ is certainly holomorphic when $\abs{z} < 1$ and when $\abs{z} > 1$ (as a composition of two holomorphic functions). It is continuous near $\abs{z} = 1$ by assumption as well, so by the Schwarz reflection principle, $g$ is entire. But $f$ is bounded by some $M > 0$ on $\abs{z} \leq 1$ by continuity, so if $\abs{z} > 1$, then $1/z \in \D$, so $g$ obeys the same bound on all of $\C$. By Liouville's theorem, $g$ is constant, and hence so is $f$.
