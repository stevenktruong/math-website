<problem>

Find all entire functions $\func{f}{\C}{\C}$ that satisfy the following two properties:

1. $\abs{f\p{z}} \leq e^{\abs{z}^2}$ for all $z \in \C$,
2. $f\p{n^{1/3}} = n$ for all $n \in \N$.

_Hint:_ $f\p{z} = z^3$ is one of them.

<solution>

Let $f$ be such a function, and let $m \geq 0$ be such that

$$
g\p{z} = \frac{f\p{z} - z^3}{z^m}
$$

is still entire. Notice that $g$ is still entire of second order and that

$$
g\p{n^{1/3}}
    = \frac{f\p{n^{1/3}} - n}{n^{m/3}}
    = 0
$$

for all $n \in \N$. Suppose that $g$ is not identically zero, so that we may apply Jensen's formula:

$$
\log\,\abs{g\p{0}} + \sum_{\abs{a_n} < R} \log\frac{R}{\abs{a_n}}
    = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \log\,\abs{g\p{Re^{i\theta}}} \,\diff\theta
    \lesssim R^2
$$

where $a_n$ denotes the zeroes of $g$. Then because each $n^{1/3}$ is a root,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    R^2
        &\gtrsim \sum_{n^{1/3} < R} \log\frac{R}{n^{1/3}} \\
        &\gtrsim \sum_{n < R^3} \log\frac{R}{R^{1/3}} \\
        &\gtrsim \floor{R^3} \log{R},
\end{aligned}
$$

which is impossible. Hence, $g$ must have been identically zero to begin with, i.e., $f\p{z} = z^3$, so $z^3$ is the only such function.
