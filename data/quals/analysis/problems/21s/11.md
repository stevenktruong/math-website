<problem>

For an entire function $f\p{z} = f^{\p{0}}\p{z}$, we define

$$
f^{\p{n}}\p{z} = f\p{f^{\p{n-1}}\p{z}}
\quad\text{for all } n \geq 1.
$$

1. Show that if there exists an $n \geq 1$ such that $f^{\p{n}}$ is a polynomial, then $f$ is a polynomial.
2. Prove that for any $n > 1$ we have $f^{\p{n}}\p{z} \neq e^z$.

<solution>

1. Suppose otherwise, and let $n$ be minimal, i.e., $f^{\p{n}}$ is polynomial but $f^{\p{n-1}}$ is not. Then $f^{\p{n-1}}$ has an essential singularity at $\infty$, so by Casorati-Weierstrass, there exists a sequence $\set{z_k}_k$ such that $z_k \to \infty$ and $f^{\p{n-1}}\p{z_k} \to z_0 \in \C$. But by continuity,

    $$
    f^{\p{n}}\p{z_k}
        = f\p{f^{\p{n-1}}\p{z_k}}
        \xrightarrow{k\to\infty} f\p{z_0}
        \neq \infty,
    $$

    but this contradicts the fact that polynomials have a pole at $\infty$. Thus, no $n$ could have existed to begin with.

2. Suppose otherwise, so that $f^{\p{n}}\p{z} = e^z$. Then

    $$
    f\p{e^z}
        = f\p{f^{\p{n}}\p{z}}
        = f^{\p{n}}\p{f\p{z}}
        = e^{f\p{z}}.
    $$

    Thus, if $g\p{z} = f\p{e^z} = e^{f\p{z}}$, then we see that $g$ must omit $0$, since $e^{f\p{z}} \neq 0$ for any $z$. Similarly, since $e^z \neq 0$, we also see that $g$ omits $f\p{0}$. Since $f$ is non-constant, little Picard implies that $f\p{0} = 0$. But this means

    $$
    1
        = e^0
        = f^{\p{n}}\p{0}
        = 0,
    $$

    a contradiction. Thus, no $n$ could have existed to begin with.
