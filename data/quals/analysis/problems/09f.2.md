<problem>

Let $v$ be a trigonometric polynomial in two variables, that is,

$$
v\p{x, y} = \sum_{n,m\in\Z} a_{n,m}e^{2\pi i\p{nx + my}},
$$

with only finitely many non-zero coefficients $a_{n,m}$. If

$$
u = v - \Delta v
$$

where $\Delta = \partial_x^2 + \partial_y^2$ is the Laplacian, prove that

$$
\norm{v}_{L^\infty\p{\br{0,1}\times\br{0,1}}} \leq C \norm{u}_{L^2\p{\br{0,1}\times\br{0,1}}}
$$

for some constant $C$ independent of $v$.
