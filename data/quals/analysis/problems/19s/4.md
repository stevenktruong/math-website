Let $\mathcal{V}$ be the subspace of $L^\infty\p{\br{0, 1}, \mu}$ (where $\mu$ is the Lebesgue measure on $\br{0, 1}$) defined by

$$
\mathcal{V}
    = \set{f \in L^\infty\p{\br{0, 1}, \mu} \st \lim_{n\to\infty} n\int_{\br{0,1/n}} f \,\diff\mu \text{ exists}}.
$$

1. Prove that there exists $\phi \in \p{L^\infty\p{\br{0, 1}}}^*$ such that $\phi\p{f} = \lim_{n\to\infty} n \int_{\br{0,1/n}} f \,\diff\mu$ for every $f \in \mathcal{V}$.
2. Show that, given any $\phi \in \p{L^\infty\p{\br{0, 1}}}^*$ satisfying the condition in (a) above, there exists no $g \in L^1\p{\br{0,1}}$ such that $\phi\p{f} = \int fg \,\diff\mu$ for all $f \in L^\infty\p{\br{0, 1}}$.

1. Let $\func{\phi}{\mathcal{V}}{\R}$ be given by

    $$
    \phi\p{f} = \lim_{n\to\infty} n \int_{\br{0,1/n}} f \,\diff\mu,
    $$

    which is well-defined by definition of $\mathcal{V}$. It's clear that this is linear, and because

    $$
    \abs{n \int_{\br{0,1/n}} f \,\diff\mu}
        \leq \norm{f}_{L^\infty},
    $$

    we see that $\norm{\phi} \leq 1$, so $\phi \in \mathcal{V}^*$. Thus, by Hahn-Banach, $\phi$ extends to a function in $\p{L^\infty\p{\br{0,1}}}^*$, which was what we wanted to show.

2. Suppose otherwise, and let $g \in L^1\p{\br{0,1}}$ represent $\phi$. Notice that if $f = \chi_{\br{a,b}}$ with $a > 0$, then $f \in L^\infty\p{\br{0,1}}$ and $\phi\p{f} = 0$. Thus, if $x \in \poc{0, 1}$ is a Lebesgue point of $g$, then for $0 < r < x$, we have

    $$
    0
        = \frac{\phi\p{\chi_{\br{x-r,x+r}}}}{2r}
        = \frac{1}{2r} \int_{\br{x - r, x + r}} g \,\diff\mu
            \xrightarrow{r\to0} g\p{x}.
    $$

    Thus, $g = 0$ a.e., but this is impossible since, for example,

    $$
    1
        = \phi\p{1}
        = \int g \,\diff\mu
        = 0.
    $$
