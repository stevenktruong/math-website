<problem>

Let $f \in C^2\p{\R}$ be a real-valued function that is uniformly bounded on $\R$. Prove that there exists a point $c \in \R$ such that $f''\p{c} = 0$.

<solution>

Suppose otherwise, and that $f''\p{x} > 0$ for all $x \in \R$. In the other case, we may replace $f$ with $-f$ and run the same argument. In this case, $f'$ is strictly increasing, so in particular, there exists $x_0 \in \R$ such that $f'\p{x_0} \neq 0$. If $f'\p{x_0} > 0$, then for $x \geq x_0$, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
    f\p{x}
        &= f\p{x_0} + \int_{x_0}^x f'\p{t} \,\diff{t} \\
        &\geq f\p{x_0} + \p{x - x_0}f'\p{x_0}
            \xrightarrow{x\to\infty} \infty,
\end{aligned}
$$

which is impossible. In the other case, if $f'\p{x_0} < 0$, we get for $x \leq x_0$ that

$$
\begin{aligned}
    f\p{x}
        &= f\p{x_0} + \int_{x_0}^x f'\p{t} \,\diff{t} \\
        &\leq f\p{x_0} + \p{x - x_0}f'\p{x_0}
            \xrightarrow{x\to-\infty} -\infty,
\end{aligned}
$$

which also contradicts the boundedness of $f$. Thus, $f''$ must vanish for some $c \in \R$, which was what we wanted to show.
