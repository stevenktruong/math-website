Let $u \in C^\infty\p{\R}$ be smooth $2\pi$-periodic. Show that there exists a bounded holomorphic function $f_+$ in the upper half-plane $\Im{z} > 0$ and a bounded holomorphic function $f_-$ in the lower half-plane $\Im{z} < 0$, such that

$$
u\p{x} = \lim_{\epsilon\to0} \,\p{f_+\p{x + i\epsilon} - f_-\p{x - i\epsilon}},
\quad x \in \R.
$$

<solution>

Since $u$ is $2\pi$-periodic, then function $u\p{\frac{\log{z}}{i}}$ is a well-defined smooth function on $S^1$. We may then solve the Dirichlet problem on the disk with boundary data $u\p{\frac{\log{z}}{i}}$ to get a harmonic function $v\p{z}$ on the disk which is continuous on $\cl{\D}$. Since $\D$ is simply connected, there exists a holomorphic function $g$ on $\D$ such that $\Im{g} = v$. Then $f\p{z} = g\p{e^{iz}}$ is a holomorphic function on the upper half-plane $\H$ such that for any $x \in \R$,

$$
\Im{f\p{x}}
    = \Im{g\p{e^{ix}}}
    = v\p{e^{ix}}
    = u\p{x}.
$$

Let $f_+ = \frac{f}{2i}$, and by Schwarz reflection, $f_-\p{z} = \conj{f_+\p{\conj{z}}}$ is a holomorphic function on the lower half-plane. Then

$$
f_+\p{x + i\epsilon} - f_-\p{x - i\epsilon}
    = \Im{f\p{x + i\epsilon}}
    \xrightarrow{\epsilon\to0} u\p{x},
$$

which was what we wanted.
