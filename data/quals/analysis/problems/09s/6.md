<problem>

Let $I_{n,j}$ as in [Problem 5](./09s.5), define the Haar function $h_{n,j} = 2^{n/2}\p{\chi_{I_{n+1,2j}} - \chi_{I_{n+1,2j+1}}}$.

1. Prove that if $f \in L^2\p{I}$ with respct to Lebesgue measure and $\int_I f \,\diff{t} = 0$, then

    $$
    \int_I \abs{f\p{x}}^2 \,\diff{x} = \sum_{n,j} \abs{\int f\p{t}h_{n,j}\p{t} \,\diff{t}}^2.
    $$

2. Prove that if $f \in L^1\p{I}$ and $\int_I f\p{t} \diff{t} = 0$, then almost everywhere on $I$,

    $$
    f\p{x} = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \sum_{j=0}^{2^n-1} \p{\int f\p{t}h_{n,j\p{t} \,\diff{t}}}h_{n,j}\p{x}.
    $$

    _Hint:_ Compare the $n$-th partial partial sum to $E_nf$ from [Problem 5](./09s.5).

<solution>

1. Let $X = \set{f \in L^2\p{I} \mid \int_I f \,\diff{t} = 0}$. Because integration is linear, it's clear that this is a linear subspace of $L^2\p{I}$. We will show that $\set{h_{n,j}}$ is an orthonormal basis for $X$.

    First, we have

    $$
    \norm{h_{n,j}}
        = \int_I \abs{h_{n,j}}^2
        = 2^n
    $$
