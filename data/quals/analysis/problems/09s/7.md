Let $\mu$ be a finite positive Borel measure on the complex plane $\C$.

1. Prove that $F\p{z} = \int_\C \frac{1}{z - w} \,\diff\mu\p{w}$ exists for almost all $z \in \C$ and that $\int_K \abs{F\p{z}} \,\diff{x} \,\diff{y} < \infty$ for every compact $K \subseteq \C$.
2. Using (1), prove that for almost every horizontal line $L$ (almost everywhere measured by $y$ intercept), and all compact $K \subseteq L$, $\int_K \abs{F\p{x + iy}} \,\diff{x} < \infty$.
3. By "almost all squares in $\C$" we mean all squares in $\C$ with sides parallel to the axes except for those squares whose lower left and and upper right vertices $\p{z_1, z_2}$ belong to a Lebesgue measure zero subset of $\C^2$. Prove that for almost all open squares $S$,

    $$
    \mu\p{S} = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{\partial S} F\p{z} \,\diff{z}.
    $$

    _Hint:_ Use (2) and the analogous result for vertical lines.

1. It suffices to prove the second claim, since it implies that for each compact $K$, $\abs{F\p{z}} < \infty$ almost everywhere on $K$, i.e., $F\p{z}$ converges almost everywhere on $K$, so $F\p{z}$ converges almost everywhere on $\C$.

    We may assume without loss of generality that $K = \cl{B\p{0, R}}$. Indeed, any compact set is contained within such a ball if $R$ is large enough, and we get the result by monotonicity.

    By applying Fubini-Tonelli, we may switch the order of integration in the following calculation:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        \int_{\cl{B\p{0,R}}} \abs{F\p{z}} \,\diff{A}
            &\leq \int_{\abs{z} \leq R} \int_{w \in \C} \frac{1}{\abs{z - w}} \,\diff\mu\p{w} \,\diff{A}\p{z} \\
            &= \int_{w \in \C} \int_{\abs{z} \leq R} \frac{1}{\abs{z - w}} \,\diff{A}\p{z} \,\diff\mu\p{w} \\
            &= \int_{\abs{w} \leq 2R} \int_{\abs{z} \leq R} \frac{1}{\abs{z - w}} \,\diff{A}\p{z} \,\diff\mu\p{w} + \int_{\abs{w} > 2R} \int_{\abs{z} \leq R} \frac{1}{\abs{z - w}} \,\diff{A}\p{z} \,\diff\mu\p{w} \\
            &\leq \int_{\abs{w} \leq 2R} \int_{\abs{z} \leq R} \frac{1}{\abs{z - w}} \,\diff{A}\p{z} \,\diff\mu\p{w} + \int_{\abs{w} > 2R} \int_{\abs{z} \leq R} \frac{1}{R} \,\diff{A}\p{z} \,\diff\mu\p{w} \\
            &\leq \int_{\abs{w} \leq 2R} \int_{\abs{z - w} \leq 3R} \frac{1}{\abs{z - w}} \,\diff{A}\p{z} \,\diff\mu\p{w} + \int_{\abs{w} > 2R} \int_{\abs{z} \leq R} \frac{1}{R} \,\diff{A}\p{z} \,\diff\mu\p{w} \\
            &= \int_{\abs{w} \leq 2R} \int_0^{3R} \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{r}{r} \,\diff{r} \,\diff\theta \,\diff\mu\p{w} + \int_{\abs{w} > 2R} \pi R \,\diff\mu\p{w} \\
            &= \int_{\abs{w} \leq 2R} 6\pi R \,\diff\mu\p{w} + \int_{\abs{w} > 2R} \pi R \,\diff\mu\p{w} \\
            &= 6\pi R\mu\p{\abs{w} \leq 2R} + \pi R\mu\p{\abs{w} > 2R} \\
            &< \infty.
    \end{aligned}
    $$

2. As before, it suffices to prove this for closed balls $\br{-R, R} \subseteq L$.

    Apply (1) and Fubini-Tonelli to $K = \br{-M, M} \times \br{n, n+1}$, where $n \in \Z$, $M \in \N$, which gives $\int_n^{n+1} \int_{-M}^M \abs{F\p{x + iy}} \,\diff{y} \,\diff{x} < \infty$. Thus, for almost every $y \in \br{n, n+1}$, we have $\int_{-M}^M \abs{F\p{x + iy}} \,\diff{x} < \infty$. Call this full measure set $Y_n^R$ and set

    $$
    Y_n = \bigcap_{M \in \N} Y_n^M.
    $$

    Notice that

    $$
    m\p{Y_n^\comp \cap \br{k, k+1}}
        \leq \sum_{k\in\Z} m\p{\p{Y_n^M}^\comp \cap \br{k, k+1}} = 0,
    $$

    so taking a union over $k \in \Z$, we see that $Y_n^\comp$ has Lebesgue measure zero. Moreover, if $y \in Y_n$, then $\int_{-M}^M \abs{F\p{x + iy}} \,\diff{x} < \infty$. Thus, if we set

    $$
    Y = \bigcup_{n\in\Z} Y_n,
    $$

    then $Y^\comp$ also has Lebesgue measure zero as a countable intersection of measure zero sets.

    Finally, let $R > 0$ and $y \in Y$. If $M \in \N$ is such that $R \leq M$, then by definition of $Y$,

    $$
    \int_{-R}^R \abs{F\p{x + iy}} \,\diff{x} \leq \int_{-M}^M \abs{F\p{x + iy}} \,\diff{x} < \infty,
    $$

    which proves the claim.

3. Notice that in (1), we proved that $\int_K \frac{1}{\abs{z - w}} \,\diff{A} < \infty$ for any compact set $K$. Thus, by replacing $\abs{F\p{z}}$ with $\int_\C \frac{1}{\abs{z - w}} \,\diff\mu\p{w}$ in (2), we see that for almost every horizontal line $L$ in $\C$ that

    $$
    \int_K \int_{w \in \C} \frac{1}{\abs{\p{x + iy} - w}} \,\diff\mu\p{w} \,\diff{x} < \infty
    $$

    for any compact $K \subseteq L$.

    If we run the same argument in (2) but with $x$ and $y$ switched, we obtain the analogous result for vertical lines with conull sets $X$ for vertical lines and $Y$ for horizontal ones.

    Let $S$ be the set of squares in $\C$ whose vertices in $X \times Y$, so $S$ contains almost every square in $\C$. Then in particular, we may integrate $\abs{F\p{z}}$ along $\partial S$. Combining this with our remark at the beginning, we may apply Fubini's theorem:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{\partial S} F\p{z} \,\diff{z}
            &= \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{\partial S} \int_{w \in \C} \frac{1}{z - w} \,\diff\mu\p{w} \,\diff{z} \\
            &= \int_{w \in \C} \p{\frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{\partial S} \frac{1}{z - w} \,\diff{z}} \,\diff\mu\p{w} \\
            &= \int_{w \in \C} \chi_S \,\diff\mu \\
            &= \mu\p{S},
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    where the second-to-last equality comes from Cauchy's integral formula, and this gives us the desired result.
