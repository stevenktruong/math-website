<problem>

Let $f\p{z}$ be an entire non-constant function that satisfies the functional equation

$$
f\p{1 - z} = 1 - f\p{z}
$$

for all $z \in \C$. Show that $f\p{\C} = \C$.

</problem>

<solution>

Suppose there exists $w \notin f\p{\C}$. This implies that $f\p{z} = w$ has no solutions. By a change of variables, this means $f\p{1 - z} = w$ has no solutions and so

$$
w = f\p{1 - z} = 1 - f\p{z} \implies f\p{z} = 1 - w
$$

has no solutions either. Thus, if $w \neq 1 - w$, this implies that $f$ misses two points, which contradicts Picard's little theorem. Hence, it must be that $w = 1 - w \implies w = \frac{1}{2}$, but this is also impossible as

$$
f\p{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = 1 - f\p{\frac{1}{2}}
\implies f\p{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{2}.
$$

Thus, no $w$ could have existed to begin with, i.e., $f\p{\C} = \C$, as required.
