Let $X$ be a Banach space and let $X^*$ be its dual Banach space. Prove that if $X^*$ is separable then $X$ is separable.

<solution>

Let $\set{f_n}_n \subseteq X^*$ be a countable, dense subset of $X^*$. For each $n \geq 1$, pick $x_n \in X$ with $\norm{x_n} = 1$ such that $\abs{f_n\p{x_n}} \geq \frac{1}{2}\norm{f_n}$. We will show that $\set{x_n}_n$ is dense in $X$.

Suppose otherwise, and that there exists $x \in X$ such that $\norm{x - x_n} \geq \delta$ for some $\delta > 0$. Let $M = \span\set{x_n \mid n \geq 1}$, which is a linear subspace of $H$. Since $x$ has positive distance from $M$, it follows that $x \notin \cl{M}$ and so by Hahn-Banach, there exists $f \in X^*$ such that $f\p{x} = 1$ and $f\p{x_n} = 0$ for all $n \geq 1$.

Since $\set{f_n}_n$ is dense in $X^*$, let $\set{f_{n_k}}_k$ be a sequence which converges to $f$ in the operator norm. This means that

$$
\norm{f_{n_k} - f}
    \geq \abs{f_{n_k}\p{x_{n_k}} - f\p{x_{n_k}}}
    = \abs{f_{n_k}\p{x_{n_k}}} \geq \frac{1}{2}\norm{f_{n_k}}.
$$

Taking $k \to \infty$, we see that $\norm{f_{n_k}} \xrightarrow{k\to\infty} 0$, which implies that

$$
\norm{f}
    \leq \norm{f - f_{n_k}} + \norm{f_{n_k}} \xrightarrow{k\to\infty} 0.
$$

But this implies that $f = 0$, which is impossible as $f\p{x} = 1$. Thus, no such $x$ could have existed to begin with, so $\set{x_n}_n$ is a countable, dense subset of $X$.
