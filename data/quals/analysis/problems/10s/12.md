Let $F$ be a function from $\D$ to $\D$ such that whenever $z_1, z_2, z_3$ are distinct points of $\D$ there exists an analytic function $f_{z_1,z_2,z_3}$ from $\D$ to $\D$ such that $F\p{z_j} = f_{z_1,z_2,z_3}\p{z_j}$. Prove that $F$ is analytic at every point of $\D$.

_Hint:_ Fix $z \in \D$ and let $\D \ni z_n \to z$, $z_n \neq z$. Show that the sequence

$$
\frac{F\p{z_n} - F\p{z}}{z_n - z}
$$

is bounded and prove that every two of its convergent subsequences have the same limit.

Let $0 < R < 1$, and let $K = \cl{B\p{0, R}}$, which is a convex compact subset of $\D$. We will show that

$$
\sup_{z,w \in K; z \neq w} \abs{\frac{F\p{z} - F\p{w}}{z - w}} < \infty.
$$

Observe that $\set{f_{z_1,z_2,z_3} \mid z_1, z_2, z_3 \in \D}$ is uniformly bounded by $1$, since their image lies in the unit disk. Thus, $\set{f_{z_1,z_2,z_3}' \mid z_1, z_2, z_3 \in \D}$ is also uniformly bounded: by Cauchy's integral formula,

$$
\abs{f_{z_1,z_2,z_3}'\p{z}}
    \leq \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{\partial K} \abs{\frac{f_{z_1,z_2,z_3}\p{\zeta}}{\p{\zeta - z}^2}} \,\diff{s}
    \leq \sup_{z_1,z_2,z_3\in\D}\,\frac{\norm{f_{z_1,z_2,z_3}}_{L^\infty\p{\D}}}{R}
    \leq \frac{1}{R}.
$$

Thus, for distinct $z, w \in K$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \abs{F\p{z} - F\p{w}}
        &= \abs{f_{z,w,z_3}\p{z} - f\p{w}_{z,w,z_3}} \\
        &\leq \int_z^w \abs{f_{z,w,z_3}'\p{\zeta}} \,\diff{s} \\
        &\leq \frac{\abs{z - w}}{1}{R} \\
    \implies
    \abs{\frac{F\p{z} - F\p{w}}{z - w}}
        & \leq \frac{1}{R},
\end{aligned}
$$

where we integrated along the segment from $z$ to $w$.

Fix $z \in \D$. Since $\abs{z} < 1$, we may pick $\abs{z} < R < 1$, which means that $\frac{F\p{\zeta} - F\p{z}}{\zeta - z}$ is bounded above by $\frac{1}{R}$. We will show that if $\set{z_n}_n, \set{w_n}_n \subseteq \D \setminus \set{z}$ are sequences which converge to $z$ and such that both

$$
\set{\frac{F\p{z_n} - F\p{z}}{z_n - z}}_n
\quad\text{and}\quad \set{\frac{F\p{w_n} - F\p{z}}{w_n - z}}_n
$$

converge, then they converge to the same limit. For $n \geq 1$, let $g_n = f_{z_n,w_n,z}$ and observe that

$$
\tag{1}
\frac{F\p{z_n} - F\p{z}}{z_n - z}
    = \frac{g_n\p{z_n} - g_n\p{z}}{z_n - z}
\quad\text{and}\quad
\frac{F\p{w_n} - F\p{z}}{w_n - z}
    = \frac{g_n\p{w_n} - g_n\p{z}}{w_n - z}.
$$

Notice that $\set{g_n}_n$ is uniformly bounded by $1$, so it admits a locally uniformly convergent subsequence $\set{g_{n_k}}_k$, which converges to some $g$. Let $\epsilon > 0$. By locally uniform convergence, $g$ is also holomorphic, so there exists $\delta > 0$ such that if $\abs{\zeta - z} < \delta$, then

$$
\tag{2}
\abs{\frac{g\p{\zeta} - g\p{z}}{\zeta - z} - g'\p{z}} < \epsilon.
$$

Similarly, by uniform convergence on $K$, there exists $N \in \N$ such that if $k \geq N$, then

$$
\tag{3}
\abs{\frac{g_{n_k}\p{\zeta} - g_{n_k}\p{\eta}}{\zeta - \eta} - \frac{g\p{\zeta} - g\p{\eta}}{\zeta - \eta}} < \epsilon
$$

for any distinct $\zeta, \eta \in K$. Thus, for $k$ large enough, $\abs{z_{n_k} - z}, \abs{w_{n_k} - z} < \delta$ and we get

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \abs{\frac{F\p{z_{n_k}} - F\p{z}}{z_{n_k} - z} - \frac{F\p{w_{n_k}} - F\p{z}}{w_{n_k} - z}}
        &= \abs{\frac{g_{n_k}\p{z_{n_k}} - g_{n_k}\p{z}}{z_{n_k} - z} - \frac{g_{n_k}\p{w_{n_k}} - g_{n_k}\p{z}}{w_{n_k} - z}}
            && (\text{by (1)}) \\
        &\leq \abs{\frac{g_{n_k}\p{z_{n_k}} - g_{n_k}\p{z}}{z_{n_k} - z} - \frac{g\p{z_{n_k}} - g\p{z}}{z_{n_k} - z}}
            + \abs{\frac{g_{n_k}\p{w_{n_k}} - g_{n_k}\p{z}}{w_{n_k} - z} - \frac{g\p{w_{n_k}} - g\p{z}}{w_{n_k} - z}}
            + \abs{\frac{g\p{z_{n_k}} - g\p{z}}{z_{n_k} - z} - \frac{g\p{w_{n_k}} - g\p{z}}{w_{n_k} - z}}
            && (\text{triangle inequality}) \\
        &\leq 2\epsilon + \abs{\frac{g\p{z_{n_k}} - g\p{z}}{z_{n_k} - z} - g'\p{z}} + \abs{\frac{g\p{w_{n_k}} - g\p{z}}{w_{n_k} - z} - g'\p{z}}
            && (\text{by (3) and the triangle inequality}) \\
        &\leq 4\epsilon.
            && (\text{by (2)})
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, because $\set{\frac{F\p{z_n} - F\p{z}}{z_n - z}}_n$ and $\set{\frac{F\p{w_n} - F\p{z}}{w_n - z}}_n$ were both convergent and we found subsequences which converge to the same limit, it follows that both sequences converge to the same limit as well. Call this limit $F'\p{z}$.

Now let $\set{z_n}_n \subseteq \D \setminus \set{z}$ be any sequence which converges to $z$. As before, $\set{\frac{F\p{z_n} - F\p{z}}{z_n - z}}_n$ is bounded above. Let $\set{z_{n_k}}_k$ be any subsequence, and by boundedness, it admits a further subsequence which converges. By our previous argument, this subsequence must be equal to $F'\p{z}$. We have shown that any subsequence of $\set{\frac{F\p{z_n} - F\p{z}}{z_n - z}}_n$ has a further subsequence which converges to $F'\p{z}$, and so

$$
\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{F\p{z_n} - F\p{z}}{z_n - z} = F'\p{z}.
$$

Thus, as our choice of $\set{z_n}_n$ was arbitrary, it follows that

$$
\lim_{w \to z; w \neq z} \frac{F\p{w} - F\p{z}}{w - z} = F'\p{z},
$$

so $F$ is analytic at $z$. Finally, our choice of $z \in \D$ was also arbitrary, so $F$ is analytic on all of $\D$, which completes the proof.
