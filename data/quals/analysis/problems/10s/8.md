<problem>

Let $F\p{z}$ be a non-constant meromorphic function on the complex plane $\C$ such that for all $z \in \C$,

$$
F\p{z + 1} = F\p{z}
\quad\text{and}\quad F\p{z + i} = F\p{z}.
$$

Let $Q$ be a square with vertices $z, z+1, z+i, z + \p{1+i}$ such that $F$ has no zeros and no poles on $\partial Q$. Prove that inside $Q$ the function $F$ has the same number of zeros as poles (counting multiplicities).

<solution>

By periodicity, the integral of $F$ along opposite edges of $Q$ will each other, which we will show explicitly. Orient $\partial Q$ counter-clockwise, and let $\gamma_T, \gamma_L, \gamma_R, \gamma_B$ be the top, left, right, and bottom segments, respectively. Then

$$
\int_{\gamma_L} F\p{z} \,\diff{z}
    = -i\int_0^1 F\p{it} \,\diff{t}
    = -i\int_0^1 F\p{1 + it} \,\diff{t}
    = -\int_{\gamma_R} F\p{z} \,\diff{z}.
$$

Similarly,

$$
\int_{\gamma_T} F\p{z} \,\diff{z}
    = -\int_0^1 F\p{t + i} \,\diff{t}
    = -\int_0^1 F\p{t} \,\diff{t}
    = -\int_{\gamma_B} F\p{z} \,\diff{z}.
$$

Hence, by the argument principle, if $N$ is the number of zeros in $Q$ and $M$ is the number of poles in $Q$ (both counting multiplicity), then

$$
0
    = \int_{\partial Q} F\p{z} \,\diff{z}
    = N - M,
$$

so $N = M$, as desired.
