1. For $f \in L^2\p{\R}$ and a sequence $\set{x_n}_{n\geq1} \subseteq \R$ which converges to zero, define

    $$
    f_n\p{x} = f\p{x + x_n}.
    $$

    Show that $\set{f_n}_{n\geq1}$ converges to $f$ in the $L^2$ sense.

2. Let $W \subseteq \R$ be a Lebesgue measurable set of positive Lebesgue measure. Show that the set of differences

    $$
    W - W = \set{x - y \mid x, y \in W}
    $$

    contains an open neighborhood of the origin.

1. We first establish the result for compactly supported smooth functions. Let $f \in C_c^\infty\p{\R}$. Let $\epsilon > 0$. Since $f$ has compact support, it is uniformly continuous on $\R$, so there exists $\delta > 0$ such that if $\abs{x - y} < \delta$, then $\abs{f\p{x} - f\p{y}} < \epsilon$. Thus, if $n$ is large enough, $\abs{x_n} < \delta$. Let $E$ denote the support of $f$, so in the worst case, the support of $f_n - f$ has measure $2m\p{E}$ when both functions have disjoint support, where $m$ denotes the Lebesgue measure. Thus,

    $$
    \int_\R \abs{f\p{x + x_n} - f\p{x}}^2 \,\diff{x}
        \leq 2m\p{E} \epsilon^2 \xrightarrow{\epsilon\to0} 0,
    $$

    so $\norm{f_n - f}_{L^2} \to 0$ if $f \in C_c^\infty\p{\R}$. For $f \in L^2\p{\R}$, we exploit the fact that $C_c^\infty\p{\R}$ is dense in $L^2\p{\R}$ with respect to the $L^2$-norm.

    Let $\epsilon > 0$ and pick $g \in C_c^\infty\p{\R}$ such that $\norm{f - g}_{L^2} < \epsilon$. Thus, if $n$ is large enough, $\norm{g\p{x + x_n} - g\p{x}}_{L^2} < \epsilon$ also, which gives

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        \norm{f\p{x + x_n} - f\p{x}}_{L^2}
            \leq \norm{f\p{x + x_n} - g\p{x + x_n}}_{L^2} + \norm{f\p{x} - g\p{x}}_{L^2} + \norm{g\p{x + x_n} - g\p{x}}_{L^2}
            < 3\epsilon.
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    Indeed, the first two terms are smaller than $\epsilon$ by density and translation invariance, and the third term is smaller than $\epsilon$ since $n$ is large. Letting $\epsilon \to 0$ completes the proof.

2. Let $f = \chi_W$. By intersecting $W$ with a large enough ball centered at the origin, we may assume without loss of generality that $0 < m\p{W} < \infty$, and so $f \in L^2\p{\R}$. By (1),

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
       \norm{f\p{x + y} - f\p{x}}_{L^2}^2
           &= \int \p{\chi_W\p{x + y} - \chi_W\p{x}}^2 \,\diff{x} \\
           &= \int \chi_W\p{x}^2 + \chi_W\p{x + y}^2 - 2\chi_W\p{x + y}\chi_W\p{x} \,\diff{x} \\
           &= 2m\p{W} - 2 \int \chi_{W}\p{x}\chi_W\p{x + y} \,\diff{x}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    tends to $0$ as $y \to 0$. In particular, there exists $\delta > 0$ so that if $\abs{y} < \delta$, then the quantity is smaller than $m\p{W}$, and so

    $$
    2m\p{W} - 2 \int \chi_{W}\p{x}\chi_W\p{x + y} \,\diff{x}
        \leq m\p{W}
    \implies 0 < \frac{m\p{W}}{2} \leq \int \chi_{W}\p{x}\chi_W\p{x + y} \,\diff{x}.
    $$

    In particular, if $\abs{y} < \delta$, then there exists $x \in W$ such that $x + y \in W$ also, and so $y = x + y - x \in W - W$, so $W - W$ contains an open neighborhood of $0$.
