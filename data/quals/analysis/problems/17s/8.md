Let $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ be $n \geq 1$ points in the disc $\D = \set{\abs{z} < 1}$ (possibly with repetitions), so that the function

$$
B\p{z} = \prod_{j=1}^n \frac{z - a_j}{1 - \conj{a_j}z}
$$

has $n$ zeros in $\D$. Prove that the derivative $B'\p{z}$ has $n - 1$ zeros in $\D$.

Let $\func{\phi_a}{\D}{\D}$ be the Blaschke factor which maps $a \in \D$ to $0$. Notice that

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \conj{\phi_a\p{1/\conj{z}}}
         = \conj{\p{\frac{\p{1/\conj{z}} - a}{1 - \conj{a/z}}}}
        &= \conj{\p{\frac{1 - a\conj{z}}{\conj{z} - \conj{a}}}} \\
        &= \frac{1 - \conj{a}z}{z - a} \\
        &= \frac{1}{\phi_a\p{z}}
\end{aligned}
$$

which gives the identity $\phi_a\p{z}\conj{\phi_a\p{1/\conj{z}}} = 1$. Thus, $B\p{z}\conj{B\p{1/\conj{z}}} = 1$ by multiplying all the terms together. Taking the derivative on both sides, we obtain

$$
\begin{aligned}
    B'\p{z}\conj{B\p{1/\conj{z}}} - \frac{1}{z^2} B\p{z}\conj{B'\p{1/\conj{z}}} = 0,
\end{aligned}
$$

which tells us that if $B\p{z} \neq 0$, then $B'\p{z} = 0 \iff B'\p{1/\conj{z}} = 0$. Another calculation gives us

$$
\frac{B'\p{z}}{B\p{z}}
    = \sum_{j=1}^n \frac{1 - \abs{a_j}^2}{\p{z - a_j}\p{1 - \conj{a_j}z}}.
$$

First, assume that $B\p{0} \neq B'\p{0} \neq 0$ and that $B$ has distinct zeroes. Multiplying the above by $\prod_{j=1}^n \p{z - a_j}\p{1 - \conj{a_j}z}$, we get a polynomial equation $P\p{z} = 0$ of degree $2n - 2$. Since the zeroes of $B$ are precisely $a_1, \ldots, a_n$, $P$ does not vanish at any of these points, so $P\p{z} = 0 \iff B'\p{z} = 0$.

Given a zero $z_j$ of $B'$ in $\D$, however, we know that $B'\p{1/\conj{z_j}}$ is a zero of $B'$ outside of $\D$. Since $B'$ has $2n - 2$ zeroes, it follows that half of them are in the disk and half are outside the disk, i.e., $B'$ has $n - 1$ zeroes in $\D$.

In the general case, by perturbing $a$ in $\phi_a$, we may approximate $B$ uniformly on compact sets by a Blaschke product $B_\epsilon$ such that $B_\epsilon\p{0} \neq B_\epsilon'\p{0} \neq 0$ and the roots of $B_\epsilon$ are all distinct. By the Cauchy integral formula,

$$
\abs{B'\p{z} - B_\epsilon'\p{z}}
    \leq \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{\partial B\p{z,r}} \frac{\abs{B\p{\zeta} - B_\epsilon\p{\zeta}}}{\abs{\zeta - z}^2} \,\diff\zeta
    \leq \frac{\norm{B - B_\epsilon}_{L^\infty}}{r}.
$$

So, it follows that $B_\epsilon'$ converges uniformly to $B'$ on compact sets and similarly, $B_\epsilon''$ converges uniformly to $B''$ on compact sets. By uniform convergence,

$$
\int_{\partial\D} \frac{B''\p{z}}{B'\p{z}} \,\diff{z}
    = \lim_{k\to\infty} \int_{\partial\D} \frac{B_\epsilon''\p{z}}{B_\epsilon'\p{z}} \,\diff{z}
    = n - 1.
$$

Since $B$ is holomorphic on $\D$, it follows that $B'$ has no poles inside of $\D$. Thus, by the argument principle, $B'$ has precisely $n - 1$ zeroes in $\D$, which completes the proof.
