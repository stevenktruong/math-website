<problem>

For $n \geq 1$, let $\func{a_n}{\pco{0,1}}{\set{0,1}}$ denote the $n$-th digit in the binary expansion of $x$, so that

$$
x = \sum_{n \geq 1} a_n\p{x} 2^{-n}
\quad\text{for all } x \in \pco{0, 1}.
$$

(We remove any ambiguity from this definition by requiring that $\liminf_{n\to\infty} a_n\p{x} = 0$ for all $x \in \pco{0, 1}$.) Let $M\p{\pco{0,1}}$ denote the Banach space of finite complex Borel measures on $\pco{0, 1}$ and define linear functions $L_n$ on $M\p{\pco{0,1}}$ via

$$
L_n\p{\mu} = \int_0^1 a_n\p{x} \,\diff\mu\p{x}.
$$

Show that no subsequence of the sequence $L_n$ converges in the weak-\* topology on $\p{M\p{\pco{0,1}}}^*$.

<solution>

Let $\set{L_{n_k}}_k$ be a subsequence. If $x$ is as given in the problem, consider the Dirac measure $\delta_x$, which gives $L_{n_k}\p{\delta_x} = a_{n_k}\p{x}$. Thus, if we have $a_{n_k}\p{x}$ alternate in $k$, then this sequence does not converge. More concretely, let

$$
x = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \p{1 + \p{-1}^k}2^{-n_k}
$$

and so $L_{n_k}\p{\delta_x} = 1 + \p{-1}^k$, which does not converge.
