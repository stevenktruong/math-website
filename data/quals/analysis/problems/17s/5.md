Let $\diff\mu$ be a finite complex Borel measure on $\br{0, 1}$ such that

$$
\hat{\mu}\p{n} = \int_0^1 e^{2\pi inx} \,\diff\mu\p{x} \to 0
\quad\text{as}\quad n \to \infty.
$$

Let $\diff\nu$ be a finite complex Borel measure on $\br{0, 1}$ that is absolutely continuous with respect to $\diff\mu$. Show that

$$
\hat{\nu}\p{n} \to 0
\quad\text{as}\quad n \to \infty.
$$

Let $\epsilon > 0$.

Since we are working with finite measures on a compact metric space, continuous functions are dense in $L^1$.

By the Lebesgue-Radon-Nikodym theorem, there exists $f \in L^1\p{\br{0,1}}$ such that $\diff\nu = f \,\diff\mu$. By Stone-Weierstrass, trigonometric polynomials are dense in $L^1\p{\br{0,1}}$, so pick $g\p{x} = \sum_{k=1}^N a_k e^{2\pi ikx}$ such that $\norm{f - g}_{L^1} < \epsilon$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \abs{\hat{\nu}\p{n}}
        &= \abs{\int_0^1 e^{2\pi inx} \,\diff\nu\p{x}} \\
        &= \abs{\int_0^1 e^{2\pi inx}f\p{x} \,\diff\mu\p{x}} \\
        &= \abs{\int_0^1 e^{2\pi inx}\p{f\p{x} - g\p{x}} \,\diff\mu\p{x} + \int_0^1 e^{2\pi inx} g\p{x} \,\diff\mu\p{x}} \\
        &\leq \int_0^1 \abs{f\p{x} - g\p{x}} \,\diff\mu\p{x} + \sum_{k=1}^N \abs{a_k \int_0^1 e^{2\pi inx} e^{2\pi ikx} \,\diff\mu\p{x}} \\
        &= \norm{f - g}_{L^1} + \sum_{k=1}^N \abs{a_k} \abs{\hat{\mu}\p{k+n}}.
\end{aligned}
$$

Sending $n \to \infty$ and applying the assumption, we get

$$
\limsup_{n\to\infty}\,\abs{\hat{\nu}\p{n}} \leq \epsilon.
$$

Sending $\epsilon \to 0$, we get the claim.
