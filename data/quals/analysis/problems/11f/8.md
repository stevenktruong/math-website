Determine the number of solutions to

$$
z - 2 - e^{-z} = 0
$$

with $z$ in the right half-plane $H = \set{z \in \C \mid \Re\p{z} > 0}$.

<solution>

Notice that any solution satisfies $z = 2 + e^{-z}$. Thus, $\abs{z} \leq 2 + \abs{e^{-z}} \leq 3$. Hence, the zeroes are contained in the half-disk $U = \set{z \in \C \mid \abs{z} < 3, \Re\p{z} > 0}$. Set $f\p{z} = z - 2$ and $g\p{z} = -e^{-z}$. Observe that if $\Re\p{z} = 0$, then $z = ai$ for some $a \in \R$ and

$$
\abs{g\p{z}} = 1 < 2 + a^2 = \abs{f\p{z}}.
$$

Similarly, if $\abs{z} = 3$,

$$
\abs{g\p{z}} < 1 = \abs{z} - 2 \leq \abs{f\p{z}}.
$$

Thus, $\abs{g\p{z}} < \abs{f\p{z}}$ on $\partial{C}$, so by Rouche's theorem, $f\p{z} = z - 2$ and $f\p{z} + g\p{z} = z - 2 - e^{-z}$ have the exact number of roots in $C$. Clearly $f\p{z}$ has $z = 2$ as its only root in $C$, so $z - 2 - e^{-z} = 0$ has precisely one root in $C$ and hence in $H$.
