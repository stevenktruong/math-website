<problem>

For an $\func{f}{\R}{\R}$ belonging to $L^1\p{\R}$, we define the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function as follows:

$$
\p{Mf}\p{x} \coloneqq \sup_{h>0}\,\frac{1}{2h} \int_{x-h}^{x+h} \abs{f\p{y}} \,\diff{y}.
$$

Prove that it has the following property: There is a constant $A$ such that for any $\lambda > 0$,

$$
\abs{\set{x \in \R \st \p{Mf}\p{x} > \lambda}} \leq \frac{A}{\lambda} \norm{f}_{L^1}
$$

where $\abs{E}$ denotes the Lebesgue measure of $E$. If you use a covering lemma, you should prove it.
