<problem>

Let $\func{f}{\C}{\C}$ be a holomorphic function with $f\p{z} \neq 0$ for all $z \in \C$. Define $U = \set{z \in \C \mid \abs{f\p{z}} < 1}$. Show that all connected components of $U$ are unbounded.

<solution>

Since $f$ vanishes nowhere, $g = \frac{1}{f}$ is also an entire function. Thus,

$$
U = \set{z \in \C \mid \abs{g\p{z}} > 1}.
$$

Notice that $U$ is open since $\abs{f}$ is continuous, and so the connected components of $U$ are open as well. If $U$ has a bounded connected component, say $C$, then we may apply the maximum principle on this domain. Since $C$ is open, $\partial{C} = \cl{C} \setminus C$, and so $\partial{C} \subseteq U^\comp$. Thus, $\abs{g\p{z}} \leq 1$ on $\partial{C}$. By the maximum principle, it follows that $\abs{g\p{z}} \leq 1$ on all of $C$, and so

$$
\frac{1}{\abs{f\p{z}}} \leq 1
\implies \abs{f\p{z}} \geq 1
$$

on $C \subseteq U$. But we assumed that $\abs{f\p{z}} < 1$ on $U$, a contradiction. Thus, no bounded connected component could have existed to begin with, which completes the proof.
