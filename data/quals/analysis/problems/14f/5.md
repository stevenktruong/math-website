Let $\func{\phi}{\br{0,1}}{\br{0,1}}$ be continuous and let $\diff\mu$ be a Borel probability measure on $\br{0,1}$. Suppose $\mu\p{\phi^{-1}\p{E}} = 0$ for every Borel set $E \subseteq \br{0,1}$ with $\mu\p{E} = 0$. Show that there is a Borel measurable function $\func{w}{\br{0,1}}{\pco{0,\infty}}$ so that

$$
\int \p{f \circ \phi}\p{x} \,\diff\mu\p{x}
    = \int f\p{y} w\p{y} \,\diff\mu\p{y}
\quad\text{for all continuous } \func{f}{\br{0,1}}{\R}.
$$

Observe that $\mu \circ \phi^{-1}$ is a measure on $\br{0, 1}$: $\mu\p{\phi^{-1}\p{\emptyset}} = \mu\p{\emptyset} = 0$ and if $\set{E_n}_n$ is a sequence of disjoint measurable sets, $\phi^{-1}\p{E_n} \cap \phi^{-1}\p{E_m} = \emptyset$ if $n \neq m$, and so $\sigma$-additivity follows from $\sigma$-additivity of $\mu$.

Notice that the assumption on $\mu \circ \phi^{-1}$ says precisely that $\mu \circ \phi^{-1}$ is absolutely continuous with respect to $\mu$. Hence, because $\mu$ is a finite measure, we may apply the Radon-Nikodym theorem to obtain $w \in L^1\p{\mu}$ such that

$$
\mu\p{\phi^{-1}\p{E}}
    = \int_E w\p{y} \,\diff\mu\p{y}.
$$

Notice also that

$$
\mu\p{\phi^{-1}\p{E}}
    = \int \chi_{\phi^{-1}\p{E}} \,\diff\mu
    = \int \chi_E \circ \phi \,\diff\mu.
$$

By linearity, we then see that

$$
\int \p{f \circ \phi}\p{x} \,\diff\mu\p{x}
    = \int f\p{y} w\p{y} \,\diff\mu\p{y}
$$

holds if $f$ is simple. Since simple functions are dense in $L^1$, it follows that this formula holds for $f \in L^1$ and in particular, for $f$ continuous.
