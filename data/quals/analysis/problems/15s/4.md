<problem>

Let $f \in L^1_{\mathrm{loc}}\p{\R}$ be $2\pi$-periodic. Show that linear combinations of the translates $f\p{x - a}$, $a \in \R$, are dense in $L^1\p{\p{0, 2\pi}}$ if and only if each Fourier coefficient of $f$ is $\neq 0$.

"$\implies$"

Suppose $\hat{f}\p{n} = 0$ for some $n$. Observe that for any linear combination $h\p{x} = \sum_{n=1}^N c_j f\p{x - a_j}$,

$$
\hat{h}\p{n}
    = \sum_{n=1}^N c_j e^{-ina_j} \hat{f}\p{n}
    = 0.
$$

Hence, linear combinations of translates of $f$ cannot possibly be dense. Indeed, consider $g\p{x} = e^{inx}$ has $\hat{g}\p{n} = 1$. Because the Fourier transform is a continuous function from $L^1 \to C_0\p{\R}$, if $\set{f_k}_k$ is a sequence of linear combinations of translates of $f$ such that $f_k \to g$ in $L^1$, then we would have$\hat{f_k} \to \hat{g}$ uniformly. However, this is impossible, since $\abs{\hat{f_k}\p{n} - \hat{g}\p{n}} = 1$ for all $k \geq 1$.

"$\impliedby$"

Let $M = \cl{\span\,\set{f\p{x - a}}_{a \in \R}}$. Suppose that $M \neq L^1\p{\p{0, 2\pi}}$ and so there exists $x_0 \in L^1\p{\p{0, 2\pi}} \setminus M$. By Hahn-Banach, there exists a linear functional $L_g \in \p{L^1\p{\p{0, 2\pi}}}^* \simeq L^\infty\p{\p{0, 2\pi}}$, i.e., integration against $g$, such that $L_g\p{x_0} \neq 0$ but $\res{L_g}{M} = 0$. Hence,

$$
h\p{a}
    = \int_0^{2\pi} f\p{x - a}g\p{x} \,\diff{x}
    = L_g\p{f\p{x - a}}
    = 0,
$$

for all $a \in \R$ by construction. Notice that by HÃ¶lder's inequality, $e^{-i\xi x}fg \in L^1$. Hence, we may apply Fubini's theorem in the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \hat{h}\p{\xi}
        &= \int_0^{2\pi} e^{-i\xi a} \int_0^{2\pi} f\p{y - a}g\p{y} \,\diff{y} \,\diff{a} \\
        &= \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} e^{-i\xi a} f\p{y - a}g\p{y} \,\diff{a} \,\diff{y} \\
        &= -\int_0^{2\pi} g\p{y} \int_0^{2\pi} e^{-i\xi \p{y-a}} f\p{a} \,\diff{a} \,\diff{y}
            && \p{a \mapsto y - a,\ f \text{ is periodic}} \\
        &= -\int_0^{2\pi} e^{-i\xi y} g\p{y} \int_0^{2\pi} e^{-i\p{-\xi} a} f\p{a} \,\diff{a} \,\diff{y} \\
        &= -\hat{g}\p{\xi} \hat{f}\p{-\xi}.
\end{aligned}
$$

But $h = 0$ almost everywhere, so $\hat{h} = 0$ everywhere. Thus,

$$
-\hat{g}\p{n}\hat{f}\p{-n}
    = \hat{h}\p{n}
    = 0
\implies \hat{g}\p{n} = 0
$$

for all $n$, since $\hat{f}\p{n} \neq 0$. Since $L^\infty\p{\p{0, 2\pi}} \subseteq L^2\p{\p{0, 2\pi}}$, we see that

$$
g\p{x} = \sum_{n \in \Z} \hat{g}\p{n} e^{inx} = 0,
$$

which is impossible as $g$ was non-zero. Hence, $M = L^1\p{\p{0, 2\pi}}$ to begin with.
