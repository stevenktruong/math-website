Let $\Omega = \set{z \in \C \mid \abs{z} > 1 \text{ and } \Re{z} > -2}$. Suppose $\func{u}{\cl{\Omega}}{\R}$ is bounded, continuous, and harmonic on $\Omega$ and also that $u\p{z} = 1$ when $\abs{z} = 1$ and that $u\p{z} = 0$ when $\Re{z} = -2$. Determine $u\p{2}$.

<solution>

First, consider the conformal map $z \mapsto \frac{1}{z}$. This fixes the unit circle, and it maps the line $\Re{z} = -2$ to the line containing

$$
-\frac{1}{2},
\quad \frac{1}{-2 + i} = \frac{-2 - i}{5},
\quad\text{and}\quad \frac{1}{\infty} = 0.
$$

This is the circle centered at $z = -\frac{1}{4}$ and with radius $\frac{1}{4}$. Thus, we have an annular region, but the circles are not concentric. To fix this, we will apply a Blaschke factor, which is a MÃ¶bius transformation fixing the unit disk of the form

$$
\phi\p{z} = \frac{z - \alpha}{1 - \conj{\alpha}z}.
$$

By symmetry, we need to map $-\frac{1}{2} \mapsto -r$ and $0 \mapsto r$, where $r > 0$ will be the radius of the resulting inner circle. We also expect $\alpha \in \R$, so we get the system

$$
\begin{gathered}
    \phi\p{-\frac{1}{2}}
        = \frac{-\frac{1}{2} - \alpha}{1 + \frac{1}{2}\conj{\alpha}}
        = \frac{-1 - 2\alpha}{2 + \alpha} = -r, \\
    \phi\p{0}
        = -\alpha
        = r.
\end{gathered}
$$

Substituting, we get

$$
-1 - 2\alpha = \alpha\p{2 + \alpha}
\implies 4\alpha + \alpha^2 = -1
\implies \alpha \in \set{-2 - \sqrt{3}, -2 + \sqrt{3}}.
$$

Since $\alpha \in \D$, we see that $\alpha = -2 + \sqrt{3}$ is the correct choice, and so $\phi$ maps $\abs{z + \frac{1}{4}} = \frac{1}{4}$ to the circle of radius $2 - \sqrt{3}$ centered at the origin. From here, we see

$$
v\p{z}
    = \frac{\log{\abs{z}}/r}{\log{1/r}}
$$

satisfies $f\p{z} = 0$ on the inner circle $\abs{z} = r$ and that $f\p{z} = 1$ on the unit circle. Thus, $v\p{z} = u\p{\frac{1}{\phi^{-1}\p{z}}}$ on $\abs{z} = r$ and $\abs{z} = 1$, so because these are both harmonic functions, we see that

$$
u\p{z}
    = \p{v \circ \phi}\p{\frac{1}{z}}
    = \frac{1}{\log{1/r}} \log\,\abs{\frac{1 + rz}{rz + r^2}}
$$

which gives

$$
u\p{2}
    = \frac{1}{\log{1/r}} \log\,\abs{\frac{1 + 2r}{2r + r^2}}.
$$
