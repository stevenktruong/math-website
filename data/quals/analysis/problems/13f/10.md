1. Let $f \in L^2\p{\R}$ and define $h\p{x} = \int_\R f\p{x - y} f\p{y} \,\diff{y}$ for $x \in \R$. Show that then there exists a function $g \in L^1\p{\R}$ such that

    $$
    h\p{\xi} = \int_\R e^{-i\xi x} g\p{x} \,\diff{x}
    $$

    for $\xi \in \R$, i.e., $h$ is the Fourier transform of a function in $L^1\p{\R}$.

2. Conversely, show that if $g \in L^1\p{\R}$, then there is a function $f \in L^2\p{\R}$ such that the Fourier transform of $g$ is given by $x \mapsto h\p{x} = \int_\R f\p{x - y} f\p{y} \,\diff{y}$.

1. Set $g = \mathcal{F}^{-1}\p{f}^2$, i.e., the square of the inverse Fourier transform of $f$. Since $f \in L^2$, it follows that $\mathcal{F}^{-1}\p{f} \in L^2$ as well, so $g \in L^1$. Thus,

    $$
    \mathcal{F}\p{g}
        = \mathcal{F}\p{\mathcal{F}^{-1}\p{f}^2}
        = \mathcal{F}\p{\mathcal{F}^{-1}\p{f * f}}
        = f * f,
    $$

    which was what we wanted to show.

2. Set $f = \mathcal{F}\p{\sqrt{g}}$. Since $g \in L^1$, it follows that $\mathcal{F}\p{\sqrt{g}} \in L^2$, so the Fourier transform is well-defined. Thus,

    $$
    f * f
        = \mathcal{F}\p{\sqrt{g}} *  \mathcal{F}\p{\sqrt{g}}
        = \mathcal{F}\p{g}.
    $$
