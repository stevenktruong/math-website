<problem>

Let $X$ be a Banach space, $Y$ be a normed linear space, and $\func{B}{X \times Y}{\R}$ be a bilinear function. Suppose that for each $x \in X$ there exists a constant $C_x \geq 0$ such that $\abs{B\p{x, y}} \leq C_x\norm{y}$ for all $y \in Y$, and for each $y \in Y$ there exists a constant $C_y \geq 0$ such that $\abs{B\p{x, y}} \leq C_y\norm{x}$ for all $x \in X$.

Show that then there exists a constant $C \geq 0$ such that $\abs{B\p{x, y}} \leq C\norm{x}\norm{y}$ for all $x \in X$ and all $y \in Y$.

First, if we fix $y \in Y$, then $x \mapsto B\p{x, y}$ is a linear functional with operator norm at most $C_y$, so we are working with a family of bounded linear functionals. Notice that our assumptions tell us that for a given $x \in X$,

$$
\abs{B\p{x, y}} \leq C_x\norm{y}
\implies \sup_{\norm{y} = 1}\,\abs{B\p{x, y}} \leq C_x.
$$

Thus, by Banach-Steinhaus, there exists $C > 0$ such that

$$
\sup_{\norm{y} = 1}\,\norm{x \mapsto B\p{x, y}}_{X\to\R} \leq C < \infty.
$$

And so $\abs{B\p{x, y}} \leq C\norm{x}$ for any $\norm{y} = 1$. If we fix $x$, then $y \mapsto B\p{x, y}$ is a bounded linear function with operator norm smaller than $C\norm{x}$, and so $\abs{B\p{x, y}} \leq C\norm{x}\norm{y}$, as required.
