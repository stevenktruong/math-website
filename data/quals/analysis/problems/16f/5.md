Let $X = C\p{\br{0,1}}$ be the Banach space of real-valued continuous functions on $\br{0,1}$ equipped with the norm

$$
\norm{f}
    = \max_{x \in \br{0,1}} \abs{f\p{x}}.
$$

Let $\mathcal{A}$ be the Borel $\sigma$-algebra on $X$.

Show that $\mathcal{A}$ is the smallest $\sigma$-algebra on $X$ that contains all sets of the form

$$
S\p{t, B} = \set{f \in X \mid f\p{t} \in B},
$$

where $t \in \br{0, 1}$ and $B \subseteq \R$ is a Borel set in $\R$.

Let $\mathcal{S}$ denote the $\sigma$-algebra generated by the $S\p{t, B}$. For $t \in \br{0, 1}$, let $\func{e_t}{X}{\R}$ be the evaluation map, i.e., $f \mapsto f\p{t}$. Observe then that

$$
\abs{e_t\p{f} - e_t\p{g}}
    = \abs{f\p{t} - g\p{t}}
    \leq \norm{f - g},
$$

so $e_t$ is continuous for any $t$. Since $e_t^{-1}\p{B} = S\p{t, B}$, it follows that $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{A}$.

Conversely, first observe that

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \norm{f} \leq r
        &\iff \max_{x \in \br{0,1}} \abs{f\p{x}} \leq r \\
        &\iff \sup_{q \in \Q \cap \br{0,1}} \abs{f\p{q}} \leq r \\
        &\iff f \in \bigcap_{q \in \Q \cap \br{0,1}} e_q^{-1}\p{\br{-r, r}}.
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus,

$$
\cl{B\p{0, r}}
    = \bigcap_{q \in \Q \cap \br{0,1}} e_q^{-1}\p{\br{-r, r}}
    \in \mathcal{S}
$$

and because translation $g \mapsto f + g$ is a continuous map $X \to X$, it follows that $\cl{B\p{f, r}} \in \mathcal{S}$ for any $f \in X$ and $r > 0$. Thus,

$$
B\p{f, r}
    = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty \cl{B\p{f, r - \frac{1}{n}}},
$$

so open balls are in $\mathcal{S}$ as well. Finally, because $X$ is separable (e.g., by Stone-Weierstrass), the topology on $X$ is generated by a countable family of open balls, and so $U \in \mathcal{S}$ for any open $U \subseteq X$. It follows that $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{S}$, so we have equality.
