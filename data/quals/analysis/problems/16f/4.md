<problem>

Let $L^1 = L^1\p{\br{0,1}}$ be the space of integrable and $L^2 = L^2\p{\br{0,1}}$ be the space of square-integrable functions on $\br{0,1}$. Then $L^2 \subseteq L^1$. Show that $L^2$ is a meager subset of $L^1$, i.e., $L^2$ can be written as a countable union of sets in $L^1$ that are closed and have empty interior in $L^1$.

<solution>

For $n \in \N$, let

$$
E_n = \set{f \in L^2 \mid \norm{f}_{L^2} \leq n}.
$$

which is closed: suppose $\set{f_k}_k \subseteq E_n$ converges to $f$ in $L^1$. Then there exists a subsequence $\set{f_{k_\ell}}_\ell$ which converges almost everywhere to $f$. By Fatou's lemma,

$$
\int \abs{f}^2
    \leq \liminf_{\ell\to\infty} \int \abs{f_{k_\ell}}^2
    \leq n^2,
$$

so $f \in E_n$. Since $L^2 \subseteq L^1$, it also follows that

$$
L^2 = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty E_n,
$$

so it remains to show that $E_n$ is nowhere dense.

First, observe that if $\phi\p{x} = x^{-1/2}$, then $\norm{\phi}_{L^1} < \infty$ and $\norm{\phi}_{L^2} = \infty$, i.e., $\phi \in L^1 \setminus L^2$. Hence, given $f \in L^2$ and $\epsilon > 0$, we see that $f - \epsilon\phi \in L^1 \setminus L^2$, or else

$$
\epsilon\phi = f - \p{f - \epsilon\phi} \in L^2.
$$

Moreover,

$$
\norm{f - \p{f - \epsilon\phi}}_{L^1}
    = \epsilon \norm{\phi}_{L^1},
$$

i.e., any open neighborhood of $f \in L^2$ contains an element in $L^1 \setminus L^2$. Thus, $E_n$ is nowhere dense for each $n$, so $L^2$ is meager.
