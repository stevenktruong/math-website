Let $\mu$ be a positive Borel measure on $\br{0, 1}$ with $\mu\p{\br{0,1}} = 1$.

1. Show that the function $f$ defined as

    $$
    f\p{z} = \int_{\br{0,1}} e^{izt} \,\diff\mu\p{t}
    $$

    for $z \in \C$ is holomorphic on $\C$.

2. Suppose that there exists $n \in \N$ such that

    $$
    \limsup_{\abs{z}\to\infty}\,\abs{\frac{f\p{z}}{z^n}} < \infty.
    $$

    Show that then $\mu$ is equal to the Dirac measure $\delta_0$ at $0$.

<solution>

1. Notice that

    $$
    \int_{\br{0,1}} \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{\abs{zt}^n}{n!} \,\diff\mu\p{t}
        \leq \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{\abs{z}^n}{n!} \int \,\diff\mu\p{t}
        = e^{\abs{z}}
        < \infty
    $$

    for any $z$. Thus, we may interchange the sum and integral in the following by Fubini's theorem:

    $$
    f\p{z}
        = \int_{\br{0,1}} \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{\p{izt}^n}{n!} \,\diff\mu\p{t}
        = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \p{\frac{i^n}{n!} \int_{\br{0,1}} t^n \,\diff\mu\p{t}} z^n,
    $$

    so $f$ is entire.

2. The assumption tells us that $f$ is a polynomial (e.g., by Cauchy estimates). Thus, we have

    $$
    f\p{z}
        = \sum_{k=0}^n a_k z_k
        = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \p{\frac{i^k}{k!} \int_{\br{0,1}} t^k \,\diff\mu\p{t}} z^k,
    $$

    so by uniqueness, $\int_{\br{0,1}} t^{n+1} \,\diff\mu\p{t} = 0$. Now suppose that $\mu$ is not the Dirac measure $\delta_0$, i.e., $\mu$ is supported on some $\br{a, b} \subseteq \br{0, 1}$ such that $a > 0$. But this means

    $$
    \int_{\br{0,1}} t^k \,\diff\mu\p{t}
        \geq \int_{\br{a,b}} t^k \,\diff\mu\p{t}
        \geq a\mu\p{\br{a,b}}
        > 0,
    $$

    a contradiction. Hence, $\mu = \delta_0$ to begin with.
