<problem>

Consider the unit sphere in $\R^3$ with poles removed:

$$
S \coloneqq \set{\p{\cos\theta\sin\phi, \sin\theta\sin\phi, \cos\phi} \mid 0 < \phi < \pi \text{ and } \theta \in \R}.
$$

Give an explicit formula for a conformal map from the complex plane onto $S$ so that horizontal lines are mapped to circles of constant $\phi$ and vertical lines are mapped to arcs of constant $\theta$.

<solution>

Let $\func{f}{\C \setminus \set{0}}{S}$ be given by stereographic projection, that is,

$$
f\p{z} = \p{\frac{2\Re{z}}{\abs{z}^2 + 1}, \frac{2\Im{z}}{\abs{z}^2 + 1}, \frac{\abs{z}^2 - 1}{\abs{z}^2 + 1}},
$$

which is a conformal map sending circles centered at the origin to circles of constant $\phi$. Notice that $f$ has inverse

$$
\begin{aligned}
    f^{-1}\p{\cos\theta\sin\phi, \sin\theta\sin\phi, \cos\phi}
        &= \frac{\cos\theta\sin\phi + i\p{\sin\theta\sin\phi}}{1 - \cos\phi} \\
        &= \p{\frac{\sin\phi}{1 - \cos\phi}}e^{i\theta}
\end{aligned}
$$

From here, we see that an arc of constant $\theta$ comes from a straight line passing through the origin that makes an angle $\theta$ with the real axis.

To find a map that sends any horizontal line to circles of constant $\phi$ and vertical lines to arcs of constant $\theta$, it suffices to find a conformal map which:

- sends horizontal lines to a circle centered at the origin and
- sends vertical lines to a line passing through the origin.
  
The map $\func{\exp}{\C}{\C \setminus \set{0}}$ does the trick:

$$
\exp\p{x + iy} = e^x\p{\cos{y} + i\sin{y}}.
$$

We see that horizontal lines, where $x$ is held constant, are mapped to circles of radius $e^x$ centered at the origin. Similarly, vertical lines, where $y$ is held constant, is mapped to a line which is contained in the line spanned by $e^{iy}$. Thus, $\func{f \circ \exp}{\C}{S}$,

$$
\p{f \circ \exp}\p{z} = \p{\frac{2\Re\p{e^z}}{\abs{e^z}^2 + 1}, \frac{2\Im\p{e^z}}{\abs{e^z}^2 + 1}, \frac{\abs{e^z}^2 - 1}{\abs{e^z}^2 + 1}}
$$

is a conformal map with the desired properties.
