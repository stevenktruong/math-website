Given $\sigma$-finite measures $\mu_1, \mu_2, \nu_1, \nu_2$ on a measurable space $\p{X, \mathcal{X}}$, suppose that $\mu_1 \ll \nu_1$ and $\mu_2 \ll \nu_2$. Prove that the product measures $\mu_1 \otimes \mu_2$ and $\nu_1 \otimes \nu_2$ on $\p{X \times X, \mathcal{X} \otimes \mathcal{X}}$ satisfy $|mu_1 \otimes \mu_2 \ll \nu_1 \otimes \nu_2$ and the Radon-Nikodym derivatives obey

$$
\deriv{\p{\mu_1 \otimes \mu_2}}{\p{\nu_1 \otimes \nu_2}}\p{x, y}
    = \deriv{\mu_1}{\nu_1}\p{x} \deriv{\mu_2}{\nu_2}\p{y}
$$

for $\nu_1 \otimes \nu_2$-almost every $\p{x, y} \in X \times X$.

Let $E \in \mathcal{X} \otimes \mathcal{X}$ and suppose $\p{\nu_1 \otimes \nu_2}\p{E}$. Then by Fubini's theorem (all measures are $\sigma$-finite)

$$
\p{\nu_1 \otimes \nu_2}\p{E}
    = \int \chi_E\p{x, y} \,\diff\nu_1\p{x} \,\diff\nu_2\p{y}
    = \int \nu_1\p{E_y} \,\diff\nu_2\p{y}
    = 0.
$$

where $E_y = \set{x \in X \mid \p{x, y} \in E}$. Since $\nu_1 \geq 0$, it follows that $\nu_1\p{E_y} = 0$ for $\nu_2$-almost every $y \in X$, so by absolute continuity, it follows that $\mu_1\p{E_y} = 0$ for $\nu_2$-almost every $y \in X$, and by absolute continuity again,

$$
\nu_2\p{\set{y \in X \mid \mu_1\p{E_y} > 0}} = 0
\implies \mu_2\p{\set{y \in X \mid \mu_1\p{E_y} > 0}} = 0,
$$

i.e., $\mu_1\p{E_y} = 0$ for $\mu_2$-almost every $y$. Hence,

$$
\p{\mu_1 \otimes \mu_2}\p{E}
    = \int \chi_E\p{x, y} \,\diff\mu_1\p{x} \,\diff\mu_2\p{y}
    = \int \mu_1\p{E_y} \,\diff\mu_2\p{y}
    = 0,
$$

so $\mu_1 \otimes \mu_2 \ll \nu_1 \otimes \nu_2$. For the second claim, by absolute continuity, we have

$$
\begin{gathered}
    \diff\p{\mu_1 \otimes \mu_2}
        = \deriv{\p{\mu_1 \otimes \mu_2}}{\p{\nu_1 \otimes \nu_2}} \,\diff\p{\nu_1 \otimes \nu_2}, \\
    \diff\mu_1
        = \deriv{\mu_1}{\nu_1} \,\diff\nu_1
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    \diff\mu_2
        = \deriv{\mu_2}{\nu_2} \,\diff\nu_2.
\end{gathered}
$$

Observe that if $A \times B \in \mathcal{X} \otimes \mathcal{X}$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \int_{A \times B} \deriv{\p{\mu_1 \otimes \mu_2}}{\p{\nu_1 \otimes \nu_2}} \,\diff\p{\nu_1 \otimes \nu_2}
        &= \p{\mu_1 \otimes \mu_2}\p{A \times B} \\
        &= \int \chi_{A \times B} \,\diff\mu_1 \,\diff\mu_2 \\
        &= \p{\int_A \diff\mu_1}\p{\int_B \diff\mu_2} \\
        &= \p{\int_A \deriv{\mu_1}{\nu_1} \,\diff\nu_1} \p{\int_B \deriv{\mu_2}{\nu_2} \,\diff\nu_2} \\
        &= \int_{A \times B} \deriv{\mu_1}{\nu_1}\p{x} \deriv{\mu_2}{\nu_2}\p{y} \,\diff\nu_1\p{x} \,\diff\nu_2\p{y}.
\end{aligned}
$$

It follows that equality holds when we replace $A \times B$ with countable unions of disjoint measurable rectangles. Hence, by Carath√©odory's theorem, we see that $\deriv{\p{\mu_1 \otimes \mu_2}}{\p{\nu_1 \otimes \nu_2}} \,\diff\p{\nu_1 \otimes \nu_2}$ and $\deriv{\mu_1}{\nu_1}\p{x} \deriv{\mu_2}{\nu_2}\p{y} \,\diff\nu_1\p{x} \,\diff\nu_2\p{y}$ agree on all measurable sets. Thus,

$$
\deriv{\p{\mu_1 \otimes \mu_2}}{\p{\nu_1 \otimes \nu_2}}\p{x, y}
    = \deriv{\mu_1}{\nu_1}\p{x} \deriv{\mu_2}{\nu_2}\p{y}
$$

$\nu_1 \otimes \nu_2$-almost everywhere.
