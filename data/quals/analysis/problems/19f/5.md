<problem>

Prove the following claim: Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a Hilbert space with the scalar product if $x$ and $y$ denoted by $\inner{x, y}$ and let $\func{A,B}{\mathcal{H}}{\mathcal{H}}$ be (everywhere-defined) linear operators with

$$
\forall x, y \in \mathcal{H},
\quad \inner{Bx, y} = \inner{x, Ay}.
$$

Then $A$ and $B$ are both bounded (and thus continuous).

<solution>

Observe that for any $y \in \mathcal{H}$,

$$
\sup_{\norm{x} = 1} \,\abs{\inner{Bx, y}}
    = \sup_{\norm{x} = 1} \,\abs{\inner{x, Ay}}
    \leq \sup_{\norm{x} = 1} \,\norm{x}\norm{Ay}
    = \norm{Ay}.
$$

Hence, by the uniform boundedness principle,

$$
C = \sup_{\norm{x} = 1} \norm{\inner{Bx, \:\cdot\:}} < \infty.
$$

It follows that

$$
\norm{Bx}^2
    = \abs{\inner{Bx, Bx}}
    \leq C\norm{Bx}
\implies \sup_{\norm{x} = 1} \,\norm{Bx} \leq C < \infty,
$$

so by definition, $\norm{B} < \infty$. For $A$, observe that $\conj{\inner{Ay, x}} = \conj{\inner{y, Bx}}$, so by symmetry, we see that $A$ is also bounded.
