Recall that $\ell^\infty\p{\N} = \set{x = \set{x_n}_n \mid \sup_{n\geq1} \abs{x_n} < \infty}$ is a Banach space (over $\R$) with respect to the norm $\norm{x}_\infty = \sup_{n\geq1} \abs{x_n}$.

1. Prove that there exists a continuous linear functional $\phi$ on $\ell^\infty\p{\N}$ such that

    $$
    \phi\p{x} = \lim_{n\to\infty} x_n
    $$

    whenever the limit exists.

2. Prove that this $\phi$ is not unique.

1. Let $M = \set{x \in \ell^\infty\p{\N} \mid \lim_{n\to\infty} x_n \text{ exists}}$. It's clear that $0 \in M$, and by linearity of limits (when they exist), we see that $M$ is closed under addition and scalar multiplication, i.e., $M$ is a subspace of $\ell^\infty\p{\N}$. Notice that $\func{\phi}{M}{\R}$ is well-defined, linear, and

    $$
    \abs{\phi\p{x}}
        \leq \sup_{n\geq1} \,\abs{x_n}
        = \norm{x}_\infty,
    $$

    i.e., $\phi \in M^*$. Hence, by Hahn-Banach, $\phi$ extends to a bounded linear functional on all of $\ell^\infty\p{\N}$, which was what we wanted to show.

2. Let $y = \set{\p{-1}^n}_{n\geq1}$. Observe that we can extend $\phi$ to $M \oplus \span{\set{y}}$ in two different ways: given $x \in M$,

    $$
    \phi_1\p{x + \lambda y}
        = \phi\p{x}
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    \phi_2\p{x + \lambda y}
        = \phi\p{x} + \lambda,
    $$

    i.e., we can extend by sending $y$ to $0$ or by $1$. We need to check that these are bounded:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        \abs{\phi_1\p{x + \lambda y}}
            &= \abs{\phi\p{x}} \\
            &\leq \max\,\set{\norm{x + \lambda y}_\infty, \norm{x - \lambda y}_\infty} \\
            &\leq \norm{x + \lambda y}.
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    Similarly,

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        \abs{\phi_1\p{x + \lambda y}}
            &= \abs{\phi\p{x} + \lambda} \\
            &\leq \max\,\set{\norm{x + \lambda y}_\infty, \norm{x - \lambda y}_\infty} \\
            &\leq \norm{x + \lambda y}.
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    Thus, $\phi_1, \phi_2$ are distinct bounded linear functionals which both extend $\phi$. By Hahn-Banach, they extend to (distinct) bounded linear functionals on all of $\ell^\infty\p{\N}$, so $\phi$ is not unique.
