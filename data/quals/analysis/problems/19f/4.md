<problem>

Let $A \subseteq \R$ be measurable with positive Lebesgue measure. Prove that the set $A - A = \set{z - y \mid z, y \in A}$ has non-empty interior.

_Hint:_ Consider the function $\phi\p{x} = \int \chi_A\p{x + y} \chi_A\p{y} \,\diff{y}$, where $\chi_A$ is the characteristic function of $A$.

<solution>

By intersecting $A$ with a large enough ball, we may assume without loss of generality that $A$ has finite positive measure. Observe that

$$
\abs{\phi\p{x} - \phi\p{0}}
    \leq \int_\R \abs{\chi_A\p{x + y} - \chi_A\p{y}} \,\diff{y}.
$$

Since $\chi_A \in L^1$ and translation is continuous in $L^1$, we see that $\phi$ is continuous at $x = 0$. Hence, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that if $\abs{x} < \delta$, then

$$
\phi\p{x}
    = \int \chi_A\p{x + y} \chi_A\p{y} \,\diff{y}
    \geq \frac{\phi\p{0}}{2}
    = \frac{m\p{A}}{2}
    > 0.
$$

In particular, $\chi_A\p{x + y}\chi_A\p{y} > 0$, i.e., there exists $y \in A$ such that $x + y \in A$, and so $x = \p{x + y} - y \in A - A$ for all $\abs{x} < \delta$. It follows that $B\p{0, \delta} \subseteq A - A$, so the set has non-empty interior.
