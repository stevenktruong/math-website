Let $J \subseteq \R$ be a compact interval, and let $\mu$ be a finite Borel measure whose support lies in $J$. For $z \in \C \setminus J$ define

$$
F_\mu\p{z} = \int_\R \frac{1}{z - t} \,\diff\mu\p{t}.
$$

Prove that the mapping $\mu \mapsto F_\mu$ is one-to-one.

Let $t_0 \in \R \setminus J$ and $\delta = d\p{t_0, J} > 0$, since $J$ is compact. Thus, if $t \in J$, then

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \frac{1}{z - t}
        &= \frac{1}{\p{z - t_0} - \p{t - t_0}} \\
        &= -\frac{1}{t - t_0} \frac{1}{1 - \frac{z - t_0}{t - t_0}} \\
        &= -\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{t - t_0} \p{\frac{z - t_0}{t - t_0}}^n \\
        &= -\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{\p{z - z_0}^n}{\p{t - t_0}^{n+1}}
\end{aligned}
$$

converges locally uniformly on $\abs{z - t_0} < \delta$. Hence,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    F_\mu\p{z}
        &= -\int_\R \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{\p{z - z_0}^n}{\p{t - t_0}^{n+1}} \,\diff\mu\p{t} \\
        &= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \p{-\int_\R \frac{1}{\p{t - t_0}^{n+1}} \,\diff\mu\p{t}} \p{z - z_0}^n.
\end{aligned}
$$

Hence, if $F_\mu = F_\nu$, then by uniqueness of power series, we get

$$
\int_\R \frac{1}{\p{t - t_0}^{n+1}} \,\diff\mu\p{t}
    = \int_\R \frac{1}{\p{t - t_0}^{n+1}} \,\diff\nu\p{t}
$$

for all $n \geq 0$. Let

$$
A = \set{\sum_{k=1}^N \frac{c_k}{\p{t - t_0}^{n_k}} \st N \in \N,\ c_k \in \R,\ n_k \in \N}.
$$

This is a subalgebra which separates points and vanishes nowhere on $J$, so by Stone-Weierstrass, $A$ is dense in $C\p{J}$. Hence, $\mu = \nu$ on a dense subset of $C\p{J}$, so they agree on all of $C\p{J}$. By Riesz representation, this means $\mu = \nu$ as measures on $J$. Since $\mu$ and $\nu$ are supported on $J$, we see that $\mu = \nu$ as measures on $\R$, which was what we wanted to show.
