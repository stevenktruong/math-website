Prove Hurwitz' Theorem: Let $\Omega \subseteq \C$ be a connected open set and $\func{f_n,f}{\Omega}{\C}$ holomorphic functions. Assume that $f_n\p{z}$ converges uniformly to $f\p{z}$ on compact subsets of $\Omega$. Prove that if $f_n\p{z} \neq 0$, $\forall z \in \Omega$, $\forall n$, then either $f$ is identically equal to $0$ or $f\p{z} \neq 0$, $\forall z \in \Omega$.

<solution>

Suppose $f$ is not identically $0$, but there exists $z_0 \in \Omega$ such that $f\p{z_0} = 0$. Thus, $z_0$ is an isolated zero of $f$, so there exists $R > 0$ such that $z_0$ is the only zero of $f$ in $\cl{B\p{z_0, R}} \subseteq \Omega$. Hence, $\abs{f\p{z}} \geq \epsilon > 0$ on $\partial B\p{z_0, R}$.

Since $f_n$ converges uniformly to $f$ on the compact set $\partial B\p{z_0, R}$, there exists $N \in \N$ such that on $\partial B\p{z_0, R}$,

$$
\abs{f_n\p{z} - f\p{z}}
    < \epsilon
    \leq \abs{f\p{z}}.
$$

By Rouché's theorem, $f$ and $\p{f_n - f} + f = f_n$ have the same number of zeroes in $B\p{z_0, R}$. But $f$ has one zero in this ball, and $f_n$ has no zeroes by assumption, a contradiction. Hence, no zero could have existed to begin with.
