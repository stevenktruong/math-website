<problem>

Let $\func{f}{\C}{\C}$ be a non-constant entire function. Without using either of the Picard theorems, show that there exist arbitrarily large complex numbers $z$ for which $f\p{z}$ is a positive real.

<solution>

Suppose otherwise, and that there exists $R > 0$ such that $\Re{f\p{z}} \leq 0$ for all $\abs{z} \geq R$. By compactness, $\Re{f}$ is bounded above by some $M > 0$ on $B\p{0, R}$ and hence all of $\C$.

Notice that $\Omega = \C \setminus \p{M, \infty}$ is simply connected, so by the Riemann mapping theorem, there exists a conformal map $\func{\phi}{\Omega}{\D}$. Thus, $\phi \circ f$ is a bounded entire function, so by Liouville's theorem, it is a constant, i.e, $\phi \circ f \equiv C$. But this implies that $f \equiv \phi^{-1}\p{C}$, so $f$ is a constant.
