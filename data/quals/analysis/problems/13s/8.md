Let $A$ and $B$ be positive definite $n \times n$ real symmetric matrices with the property

$$
\norm{BA^{-1}x} \leq \norm{x}
\quad\text{for all } x \in \R^n
$$

where $\norm{x}$ denotes the usual Euclidean norm: $\norm{x}^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n \abs{x_i}^2$.

1. Show that for each pair $x, y \in \R^n$,

    $$
    z \mapsto \inner{y, B^zA^{-z}x}
    $$

    admits an analytic continuation from $0 < z < 1$ to the whole complex plane. Here $\inner{\:\cdot\:, \:\cdot\:}$ denotes the usual Euclidean inner product on $\R^n$.

2. Show that

    $$
    \norm{B^\theta A^{-\theta} x} \leq \norm{x}
    $$

    for all $0 \leq \theta \leq 1$.

1. Since $A$ and $B$ are positive definite, we can express $A = S_AD_AS_A^{-1}$ and $B = S_BD_BS_B^{-1}$, where $D_A$ and $D_B$ are diagonal matrices with positive entries on the diagonal. Thus, we may define $A^z = D_A^z$ and $B^z = D_B^z$, where we raise each entry in the diagonal matrix to the $z$-th power. Thus, when expanding out $\inner{y, B^zA^{-z}x}$, we get a finite linear combination of functions of the form $a^z$ with $a > 0$, hence entire.
2. We wish to apply Hadamard's three-lines theorem. If $\Re{z} = 0$, then observe that $B^0$ and $A^0$ have eigenvalues $1$, so they have operator norm $1$. Thus, by Cauchy-Schwarz,

    $$
    \abs{\inner{y, B^zA^{-z}x}}
        \leq \norm{x}\norm{y}.
    $$

    If $\Re{z} = 1$, write $z = 1 + bi$. The eigenvalues of $A^{-ib}, B^{ib}$ take the form $\lambda^{ib} = e^{ib\log{\lambda}}$, which have absolute value $1$. Hence,

    $$
    \norm{B^zA^{-z}}
        = \norm{B^{ib}BA^{-1}A^{-bi}}
        \leq \norm{B^{ib}}\norm{BA^{-1}}\norm{A^{-bi}}
        \leq 1
    $$

    by assumption, so by Cauchy-Schwarz again,

    $$
    \abs{\inner{y, B^zA^{-z}x}}
        \leq \norm{B^zA^{-z}x}\norm{y}
        \leq \norm{x}\norm{y}.
    $$

    Since $f_{x,y}\p{z} = \inner{y, B^zA^{-z}x}$ is entire, it is in particular holomorphic near the strip $S = \set{z \mid 0 \leq \Re{z} \leq 1}$, so by the Hadamard three-lines theorem, if we set $M\p{t} = \sup_{b}\,\abs{f_{x,y}\p{t + ib}}$ and $\theta = 1 - t$ for $\theta \in \br{0, 1}$, we obtain

    $$
    M\p{\theta} \leq M\p{0}^t M\p{1}^{1-t} \leq \norm{x}\norm{y}.
    $$

    Hence, in particular, $\abs{\inner{y, B^\theta A^{-\theta}x}} \leq \norm{x}\norm{y}$. Taking the supremum over $\norm{y} = 1$, we obtain

    $$
    \norm{B^\theta A^{-\theta}x} \leq \norm{x},
    $$

    which completes the proof.
