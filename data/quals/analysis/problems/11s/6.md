Suppose $\mu$ and $\nu$ are finite positive (regular) Borel measures on $\R^n$. Prove the existence and uniqueness of the Lebesgue decomposition: There are a unique pair of positive Borel measures $\mu_a$ and $\mu_s$ so that

$$
\mu = \mu_a + \mu_s,
\quad \mu_a \ll \nu,
\quad\text{and}\quad \mu_s \perp \nu.
$$

That is, $\mu_a$ is absolutely continuous to $\nu$, while $\mu_s$ is mutually singular to $\nu$.

<solution>

Let $\mathcal{B}$ denote the Borel $\sigma$-algebra and set

$$
M = \sup\,\set{\mu\p{B} \mid B \in \mathcal{B} \text{ and } \nu\p{B} = 0}.
$$

Observe that for any $B \in \mathcal{B}$, $\nu\p{B} \leq \mu\p{X} < \infty$, so taking supremums, we see $M \leq \mu\p{X} < \infty$. Hence, for each $n \geq 1$, there exists $B_n \in \mathcal{B}$ with $\nu\p{B_n} = 0$ and $\mu\p{B_n} \geq M - \frac{1}{n}$. If we set $A = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty B_n$, then

$$
\nu\p{A}
    \leq \sum_{n=1}^\infty \nu\p{B_n} = 0
\implies \mu\p{A} \leq M,
$$

by definition of $M$. Moreover,

$$
\mu\p{A}
    = \mu\p{\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty B_n}
    = \lim_{N\to\infty} \mu\p{\bigcup_{n=1}^N B_n}
    \geq \lim_{N\to\infty} \p{M - \frac{1}{N}}
    = M,
$$

so $\mu\p{A} = M$, i.e., the supremum is attained. For $B \in \mathcal{B}$, define

$$
\mu_a\p{B} = \mu\p{B \setminus A}
\quad\text{and}\quad
\mu_s\p{B} = \mu\p{B \cap A}.
$$

Since $\mu$ is a finite Borel measure, it's clear that these are also finite Borel measures. We will show that they satisfy the given properties:

If $\nu\p{B} = 0$, then $\nu\p{A \cup B} = 0$ as well so

$$
M
    =  \mu\p{A}
    \leq \mu\p{A \cup B}
    \leq M
$$

by definition of $M$, so these are all equalities. Hence, by measurability of $B$,

$$
M
    = \mu\p{A \cup B}
    = \mu\p{A} + \mu\p{E \setminus A}
    = M + \mu_a\p{B}
\implies
\mu_a\p{B} = 0,
$$

so $\mu_a \ll \nu$. On the other hand, $\R^n = A \cup A^\comp$, $A \cap A^\comp = \emptyset$, $\nu\p{A} = 0$, and $\mu_s\p{A^\comp} = \mu_s\p{\emptyset} = 0$, so $\mu_s \perp \nu$. Finally, by measurability of $A$, $\mu\p{B} = \mu\p{B \setminus A} + \mu\p{B \cap A} = \mu_a\p{B} + \mu_s\p{B}$ for any $B$, which proves existence.

It remains to show uniqueness. Suppose $\mu = \mu_a + \mu_s = \mu_a' + \mu_s'$ are two Lebesgue decompositions of $\mu$. Then $\mu_a - \mu_a' = \mu_s' - \mu_s$. If $\nu\p{B} = 0$, then by absolute continuity,

$$
0
    = \mu_a\p{B} - \mu_a'\p{B}
    = \mu_s\p{B} - \mu_s'\p{B}
\implies \mu_s\p{B} = \mu_s'\p{B}.
$$

On the other hand, if $\nu\p{B} > 0$, then let $A, A'$ be such that $\mu_s\p{A} = 0$ and $\nu\p{A^\comp} = 0$; $\mu_s'\p{A'} = 0$ and $\nu\p{A'^\comp} = 0$, which exist since $\mu_s, \mu_s' \perp \nu$. If we set $A'' = A \cap A'$, then $\mu_s\p{A''} = \mu_s'\p{A''} = 0$ and $\nu\p{A''^\comp} = 0$. Hence,

$$
\mu_s\p{B}
    = \mu_s\p{B \setminus A''}
\quad\text{and}\quad
\mu_s'\p{B}
    = \mu_s'\p{B \setminus A''},
$$

but $\nu\p{B \setminus A''} = 0$, so by absolutely continuity again, $\mu_a\p{B \setminus A''}$. Thus,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    0
        &= \mu_a\p{B \setminus A''} - \mu_a'\p{B \setminus A''} \\
        &= \mu_s\p{B \setminus A''} - \mu_s'\p{B \setminus A''} \\
        &= \mu_s\p{B} - \mu_s'\p{B} \\
    \implies
    \mu_s\p{B}
        &= \mu_s'\p{B}.
\end{aligned}
$$

Hence, $\mu_s = \mu_s' \implies \mu_a = \mu_a'$, so the decompositions are the same.
