Let $\Top$ be the category of topological spaces. Recall that a morphism $f$ in some category is called a monomorphism if, for any two morphisms $g_1$ and $g_2$ that can be precomposed with $f,$ $f \circ g_1 = f \circ g_2$ implies $g_1 = g_2$. Dually, $f$ is called an epimorphism of, for any $g_1$ and $g_2$ that can be post-composed with $f$, $g_1 \circ f = g_2 \circ f$ implies $g_1 = g_2$.

1. Show that a continuous map $\func{f}{X}{Y}$ is a monomorphism in $\Top$ if and only if $f$ is one-to-one.

2. Now show by example that an epimorphism in $\Top$ need not be onto.

1. "$\implies$"

   Let $\func{f}{X}{Y}$ be a continuous monomorphism, and suppose $f\p{x_1} = f\p{x_2}$, where $x_1, x_2 \in X$. Let $Z = \set{x_1, x_2}$ and endow it with the discrete topology. Define $\func{g_1,g_2}{Z}{X}$ by $g_i\p{x} = x_i$. These are continuous maps since $Z$ has the discrete topology. Then

   $$
   f\p{g_1\p{x}} = f\p{x_1} = f\p{x_2} = f\p{g_2\p{x}}.
   $$

   Thus, $f \circ g_1 = f \circ g_2 \implies g_1 = g_2$, since $f$ is a monomorphism. Thus, $x_1 = x_2$, so $f$ is one-to-one.

   "$\impliedby$"

   Suppose $\func{f}{X}{Y}$ is one-to-one. Given any $\func{g_1,g_2}{Z}{X}$ such that $f \circ g_1 = f \circ g_2$, we have by injectivity of $f$ that

   $$
   f\p{g_1\p{x}} = f\p{g_2\p{x}} \implies g_1\p{x} = g_2\p{x}
   $$

   for any $x \in Z$, so $g_1 = g_2$.

2. Let $\func{i}{\Q}{\R}$ be the inclusion, which is continuous. Given any $\func{g_1,g_2}{\R}{\R}$, we see that $g_1 \circ i = g_2 \circ i$ means that $g_1$ and $g_2$ agree on a dense subset of $\R$. Since $g_1$ and $g_2$ are continuous functions, they must agree everywhere, so $g_1 = g_2$. Thus, $i$ is an epimorphism which isn't onto.
