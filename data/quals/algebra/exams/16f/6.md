<problem>

Let $F$ be a field of characteristic $p > 0$. Prove that for every $a \in F$, the polynomial $x^p - a$ is either irreducible or splits into a product of linear factors.

<solution>

Notice that in $F\p{a^{1/p}}$, $f = x^p - a$ splits via the Frobenius homomorphism:

$$
f = \p{x - a^{1/p}}^p.
$$

If $a^{1/p} \in F$, then $f$ splits as above. Otherwise, suppose $a^{1/p} \notin F$, let $g$ be the minimal polynomial of $a^{1/p}$ over $F$ with $k = \deg{g} < p$, and write $f = gh$. Since $F\p{a^{1/p}}$ is a UFD, it follows that $f = \p{x - a^{1/p}}^k$. But the coefficient of $x^{k-1}$ is $\p{-1}^k ka^{k/p}$, which means $a^{k/p} \in F$. Since $p$ is prime, there exist $b, c \in \Z$ such that $bp + ck = 1$, which gives

$$
F
    \ni \p{a^{k/p}}^c \cdot a^b
    = a^{\p{1 - bp}/p} \cdot a^b
    = a^{1/p},
$$

a contradiction. Hence, $\deg{g} = p$, i.e., $f = g$ and $f$ is irreducible.
