<problem>

Let $F$ be a field and $A$ a simple subalgebra of a finite dimensional $F$-algebra $B$. Prove that $\dim_F\p{A}$ divides $\dim_F\p{B}$.

</problem>

<solution>

This problem is false as written. For example, let $F = \C$, $A = M_2\p{\C}$, and $B = M_2\p{\C} \times M_3\p{\C}$. Then $A$ is a simple $F$-subalgebra of $B$, but $4$ does not divide $13$.
