Let $G$ be a group generated by $a$ and $b$ with only relation $a^2 = b^2 = 1$ for the group identity $1$. Determine the group structure of $G$ and justify your answer.

<solution>

$G$ is the free product $C_2 * C_2$. Indeed, we have the maps $\func{\phi_1, \phi_2}{C_2}{G}$ given via $\phi_1\p{x} = a$ and $\phi_2\p{x} = b$, which are well-defined since $a^2 = b^2 = 1$. Now suppose $H$ is another group, and let $\func{\psi_1, \psi_2}{C_2}{H}$ be group homomorphisms.

Suppose we had a map $\func{f}{G}{H}$ such that the triangle commutes:

$$
\p{f \circ \phi_i}\p{x} = \psi_i\p{x}
\quad\text{for } i = 1, 2.
$$

Since $\phi_1\p{x}, \phi_2\p{x}$ generate $G$, this uniquely determines $f$. Moreover, when defined this way, $f$ is a group homomorphism as

$$
\p{f \circ \phi_i}\p{x}^2
    = \psi_i\p{x}^2
    = \psi_i\p{x^2}
    = 1
$$

for $i = 1, 2$. Hence, $G$ has the universal property of the free product $C_2 * C_2$, so $G \simeq C_2 * C_2$.
