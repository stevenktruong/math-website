<problem>

Let $A$ be a commutative ring, $S$ a multiplicatively closed subset of $A$, $A \to A\br{S^{-1}}$ the localization.

1. Which elements of $A$ map to zero in $A\br{S^{-1}}$?
2. Let $\mathfrak{p}$ be a prime ideal in $A$. Show that the ideal generated by the image of $\mathfrak{p}$ in $A\br{S^{-1}}$ is prime if and only if the intersection of $\mathfrak{p}$ with $S$ is empty.

<solution>

1. Suppose $a$ maps to $0$ in $A\br{S^{-1}}$; that is, $\frac{a}{1} = 0$. By definition, there exists $s \in S$ so that $as = 0$ in $A$. Conversely, suppose $a \in A$ is annihilated by $S$, i.e., $as = 0$ for some $s \in S$. Then in $A\br{S^{-1}}$, we have

    $$
    \frac{a}{1}
        = \frac{as}{s}
        = 0,
    $$

    so the elements in $A$ which map to zero in the localization are precisely the elements annihilated by $S$.

2. "$\implies$":

    Assume the ideal $I = S^{-1}\mathfrak{p}$ is prime. If there exists $s \in \mathfrak{p} \cap S$, then $I$ is all of $A\br{S^{-1}}$, but this means $I$ is not prime. Thus, $\mathfrak{p} \cap S = \emptyset$.

    "$\impliedby$":

    Suppose $\mathfrak{p} \cap S = \emptyset$, and assume $\frac{a}{s} \cdot \frac{b}{t} \in I$, where $I$ is as above. Then $\frac{ab}{st} = \frac{p}{r}$ for some $p \in \mathfrak{p}$. Thus, $rab = pst \in \mathfrak{p}$, and by assumption, $r \notin \mathfrak{p}$, so because $\mathfrak{p}$ is prime, we have $ab \in \mathfrak{p}$. Thus, $a$ or $b$ is in $\mathfrak{p}$, which implies $\frac{a}{s}$ or $\frac{b}{t}$ is in $I$, so $I$ is prime.
