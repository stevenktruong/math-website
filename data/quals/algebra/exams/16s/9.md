<problem>

Show that if $G$ is a finite group acting transitively on a set $X$ with at least two elements, then there exists $g \in G$ which fixes no point of $X$.

</problem>

<solution>

Since $G$ is transitive, there is only one orbit. Thus, by Burnside's lemma,

$$
1
    = \frac{1}{\abs{G}} \sum_{g \in G} \abs{X^g}
    = \frac{1}{\abs{G}} \p{\abs{X} + \sum_{g \in G \setminus \set{e}} \abs{X^g}}
$$

where $X^g$ is the set of fixed points of $g$. If the claim were false, then $\abs{X^g} \geq 1$ for each $g \in G$, but this means

$$
\abs{G}
    \geq \abs{X} + \p{\abs{G} - 1}
    \geq 2 + \abs{G} - 1
    = \abs{G} + 1,
$$

which is a contradiction. Hence, the claim holds.
