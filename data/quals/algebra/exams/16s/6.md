<problem>

Let $K$ be a field of characteristic $p > 0$. For an element $a \in K$, show that the polynomial $P\p{X} = X^p - X + a$ is irreducible over $K$ if and only if it has no root in $K$. Show also that, if $P$ is irreducible, then any root of it generates a cyclic extension of $K$ of degree $p$.

<solution>

Notice that over the splitting field of $P$, if $\alpha$ is a root of $P$, then for $i \in \Z/p\Z$, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P\p{\alpha + i}
        &= \p{\alpha + i}^p - \p{\alpha + i} + a \\
        &= \alpha^p + i^p - \alpha - i + a \\
        &= \alpha^p - \alpha + a \\
        &= P\p{\alpha} \\
        &= 0.
\end{aligned}
$$

For the third equality, we used the fact that $\p{\Z/p\Z}^\times \simeq \Z/\p{p-1}\Z$, i.e., $i^p = i$. Thus, if $P$ has a root in $K$, then it automatically has all its roots $\alpha, \alpha + 1, \ldots, \alpha + \p{p-1}$ in $K$ as well, so $P$ is irreducible if and only if $P$ has no roots in $K$.

For the second claim, note that the calculation above shows that the splitting field of $P$ is $K\p{\alpha}$ where $\alpha$ is any root of $P$. Moreover, it also shows $P$ is separable, so $K\p{\alpha}/K$ is Galois. Hence, $\abs{\Gal\p{K\p{\alpha}/K}} = \br{K\p{\alpha} : K} = p$, so $\Gal\p{K\p{\alpha}/K} \simeq C_p$, which was what we wanted to show.
