1. Determine the Galois group of the polynomial $X^4 - 2$ over $\Q$, as a subgroup of a permutation group. Also, give generators and relations for this group.
2. Determine the Galois group of the polynomial $X^3 - 3X - 1$ over $\Q$. (_Hint:_ for polynomials of the form $X^3 + aX + b$, the quantity $\Delta = -4a^3 - 27b^2$, known as the discriminant, plays a key theoretical role.) Explain your answer.

1. Over $\C$, the roots of $f = X^4 - 2$ are $2^{1/4}, i2^{1/4}, -2^{1/4}$, and $-i2^{1/4}$, so the splitting field of $f$ is $\Q\p{2^{1/4}, i}$. Consider the tower

    $$
    \Q \subseteq \Q\p{2^{1/4}} \subseteq \Q\p{2^{1/4}, i}.
    $$

    Note that $\br{\Q\p{2^{1/4}} : \Q} = 4$ since $X^4 - 2$ is irreducible by Eisenstein with $p = 2$. For the second inclusion, note that $X^2 + 1$ is still irreducible over $\Q\p{2^{1/4}}$, since $i \notin \Q\p{2^{1/4}} \subseteq \R$, so $\br{\Q\p{2^{1/4}, i} : \Q} = 8$.

    The maps $\sigma\colon 2^{1/4} \mapsto i2^{1/4}$ and $\tau\colon i \mapsto -i$ are all field automorphisms fixing $\Q$. Moreover, these satisfy the relation $\sigma^4 = \tau^2 = \sigma\tau\sigma\tau = \id$. Thus, $\gen{\sigma, \tau} = D_4$ in the Galois group, but because $\Q\p{2^{1/4}, i}/\Q$ is Galois, it follows that $\Gal\p{\Q\p{2^{1/4}, i}} \simeq D_4 \leq S_4$.

2. Notice that by the rational roots theorem, the only possible roots in $\Q$ are $1$ and $-1$, which are not roots. Thus, $f = X^3 - 3X - 1$ has no roots in $\Q$, hence irreducible as any reducible cubic polynomial will have a linear factor.

    The discriminant of $f$ is $\Delta = -4 \cdot \p{-3}^3 - 27 \cdot \p{-1}^2 = 81 = 9^2$. Thus, any $\sigma$ in the Galois group $G$ of $f$ fixes $\sqrt{\Delta} = 9$, so $G \leq A_3$. We deduce $\abs{G} \leq 3$, but because $f$ is irreducible, we also have $\abs{G} \geq 3$, so $\abs{G} = 3$, hence $G \simeq C_3$.
