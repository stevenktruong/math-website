<problem>

Consider the functor $F$ from commutative rings to abelian groups that takes a commutative ring $R$ to the group $R^\times$ of invertible elements. Does $F$ have a left adjoint? Does $F$ have a right adjoint? Justify your answers.

<solution>

$F$ is a forgetful functor, so its left adjoint is a universal construction. Hence, $F$ has the functor $A \mapsto \Z\br{A}$ as a left adjoint. If $F$ were a left adjoint, then in particular $F$ must preserve colimits. However, if $A = \Z/2\Z$ and $B = \Z/3\Z$, then

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \Z/2\Z \amalg_{\CRing} \Z/3\Z
        &\simeq \Z/2\Z \otimes_\Z \Z/3\Z \\
        &\simeq \Z/{\gcd\p{2, 3}}\Z \\
        &\simeq 0,
\end{aligned}
$$

but this would mean

$$
\begin{aligned}
    1
        &\simeq F\p{\Z/2\Z \amalg_{\CRing} \Z/3\Z} \\
        &\simeq F\p{\Z/2\Z} \amalg_{\Ab} F\p{\Z/3\Z} \\
        &\simeq 1 \oplus \Z/2\Z,
\end{aligned}
$$

which is impossible. Hence, $F$ has no right adjoint.
