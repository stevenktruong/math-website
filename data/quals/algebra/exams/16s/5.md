<problem>

Let $A$ be the ring $\C\gen{u, v}/\gen{uv - vu - 1}$, the quotient of the free associative algebra on two generators by the two-sided ideal.

1. Show that every nonzero $A$-module $M$ has infinite dimension as a complex vector space.
2. Let $M$ be an $A$-module with a nonzero element $y$ such that $uy = 0$. Show that the elements $y, vy, v^2y, \ldots$ are $\C$-linearly independent in $M$.

<solution>

Let $y \in M$ be nonzero. If $uy = 0$ and $vy = 0$, then

$$
0
    = u\p{vy}
    = \p{vu + 1}y
    = v\p{uy} + y
    = y.
$$

Thus, at least one of $uy$ and $vy$ is nonzero. Without loss of generality, suppose $uy = 0$ so that $vy \neq 0$. It remains to show that $y, vy, v^2y, \ldots$ are linearly independent.

Suppose $c_0y + c_1vy + \cdots + c_nv^ny = 0$. First, note that for $j \geq 1$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    uv^j
        &= \p{vu + 1}v^{j-1} \\
        &= vuv^{j-1} + v^{j-1} \\
        &= v\p{vuv^{j-2} + v^{j-2}} + v^{j-1} \\
        &= v^2uv^{j-2} + 2v^{j-1}.
\end{aligned}
$$

By induction, we see $uv^j = v^ju + jv^{j-1}$.

We now proceed by induction. $\set{y}$ is linearly independent since $y \neq 0$, so now assume $\set{y, vy, \ldots, v^ny}$ are all linearly independent. Suppose $c_0y + c_1vy + \cdots + c_nv^ny = 0$, and left multiply by $u$, which gives

$$
\begin{aligned}
    0
         = u \cdot \sum_{j=0}^n c_jv^jy
        &= \sum_{j=0}^n c_j \p{uv^j} y \\
        &= \sum_{j=1}^n c_j \p{v^ju + jv^{j-1}}y \\
        &= \sum_{j=1}^n jc_j v^{j-1}y.
\end{aligned}
$$

By the inductive hypothesis, it follows that $c_1 = \cdots = c_n = 0$, so we have $c_0y = 0$. By the base case, $c_0 = 0$ as well, so we have linear independence, which means $M$ is infinite dimensional.
